    This volume is the third annual cumulation of the Book Review
Digest. It includes principally the books of 1907 that have been
reviewed by the best book critics in England and America. It aims first
to record with unprejudiced exactness the scope, character and subject
content of books as they appear, and further, to supplement this
descriptive information from month to month with excerpts culled from
the best current reviews appearing in forty-seven English and American
magazines which give prominence to book criticism, thus furnishing to
the librarian a basis for the valuation of books. Frequently the best
reviews of a book appear during the year following its publication, so
in this volume will be found supplementary excerpts relating to books
which were entered in the 1906 annual. It will be observed that a number
of entries include only the descriptive note. Reviews for these books
have not yet appeared; 1908 will furnish the material for appraisal, and
excerpts will be included in current numbers of the digest as fast as
reviews are published.

    In sending out this annual the publishers wish to emphasize the
coöperative phase of the undertaking. From three to six people have been
engaged during 1907 in the work of preparing descriptive notes to
approximately 2,800 books, and clipping from 1,000 copies of magazines
sentences most helpful for book selection. This card-index information
furnished to libraries for five dollars per year would cost them many
hundred times this sum should they do it themselves. For the time thus
given to a valuable and indispensable part of library work the
publishers look for an equivalent in the support of libraries all over
the country. The justice of the statement “Time is Money” is
commensurate with its economic terseness.

    An Asterisk (*) before the price indicates those books sold at a
      limited discount and commonly known as net books. Books subject to
      the rules of the American Publishers’ Association are marked by a
      double asterisk (**) when the bookseller is required to maintain
      the list price; by a dagger (†) when the maximum discount is fixed
      at 20 and 10 per cent, as is allowable in the case of fiction.

    The plus and minus signs preceding the names of the magazines
      indicate the degree of favor or disfavor of the entire review.

    In the reference to a magazine, the first number refers to the
      volume, the next to the page and the letters to the date.

    Books noticed for the first time this month have an asterisk (*)
      immediately below the author’s name in entry heading.

    A Maltese Cross (✠) indicates that the A. L. A. Booklist suggests
      the books for first purchase. The letter S indicates that the same
      publication recommends the book for small libraries.

        The publications, named above, undoubtedly represent the leading
reviews of the English-speaking world. Few libraries are able to
subscribe for all and the smaller libraries are supplied with
comparatively few of the periodicals from which the digests are to be
culled. For this reason the digest will be of greater value to the small
libraries, since it places at their disposal, in most convenient form, a
vast amount of valuable information about books, which would not
otherwise be available.

        We shall endeavor to make the descriptive notes so
comprehensive, and the digests so full and accurate, that librarians who
do not have access to the reviews themselves, will be able to arrive at
substantially correct appreciations of the value of the books reviewed.

        This is particularly true in regard to the English periodicals,
which are practically out of the reach of the ordinary library, we shall
endeavor to make the digest of these reviews so complete that there will
be little occasion to refer to the original publications.

  A posthumous work that represents a life time of study. “The
  determining principle of the whole structure is that ‘whatever is
  evolved as consequent must be involved as antecedent.’ The outcome of
  this ‘principle of absolute logic’ is that personality, in the
  philosophic sense of the word, is ‘both the source and outcome of all
  that is,’ and that philosophy at last becomes ‘theology modernized as
  scientific realism and scientific theism.’” (Outlook.)

  “We confess that we have found in his work little to clarify the
  problems of philosophy and nothing besides the author’s own
  earnestness and enthusiasm which we can call uplifting. In no way does
  the book appear to us to be a prolegomena to science or an important
  contribution to philosophy.”

  “They are erudite and earnest, but dogmatic and ineffective. We do not

  “Well equipped with wide and careful reading as Dr. Abbot evidently
  was, he seems to have fallen upon an arid formalism which forces him
  to serve up afresh, and with reiterated emphasis, many of the

  nineteenth century.”

  From the point of view of the worker of magic, Mr. Abbott, who is not
  a medium, reveals all the tricks of the séance. “The ardent believers
  whose faith no number of exposures can disturb, the skeptics whom no
  sort of séance has been able to convince, and the scientific
  investigators toward whom the author is a bit contemptuous, will all
  find in its pages matter in plenty either interesting or irritating.”

  “In reply to friendly dissentients from his views, especially as
  expressed in his previous book, ‘Silanus the Christian,’ the author
  publishes this ‘explanation and defense’ of them as an introduction to
  two volumes of a technical and critical character to appear presently.
  His view of the Biblical miracles is ‘that some are literally true,
  but in accordance with what are called laws of nature; others are not
  literally true, but are metaphorical or poetical traditions
  erroneously taken as literal; others are visions that have been
  erroneously taken as non-visionary facts.’”—Outlook.

  “It may be pointed out that Dr. Abbott’s reason for calling Christ
  supernatural has nothing to do with the evidence furnished in the New
  Testament and it is therefore not easy to see why there should be such
  a waste of interpretation as there is in his books.”

  Dr. Abbott addresses himself to readers who are not ready to accept
  the miraculous element in the New Testament and who at the same time
  do not reject the doctrine of Christ’s divinity. He shows that the
  belief is not rendered impossible by the disbelief. The book is in the
  form of an autobiography of an educated Roman. “The gist of its
  teaching—and it is solely intended to teach—is summed up in the words
  of Clemens. It has been said, he tells Silanus, that the religion of
  the Christians is a person—and nothing more. ‘I should prefer to say
  the same thing differently. Our religion in a person—and nothing
  less.’” (Spec.)

                  *       *       *       *       *

  “Dr. Abbott’s writing is itself interesting on account of the literary
  skill with which he presents innumerable points of exposition and
  criticism, and on account, too, of the beauty and strength of many of
  its passages.”

     + − =Ath.= 1906, 2: 766. D. 15. 1040w.

  “While the book aims to be popular, the author’s wide knowledge and
  competent scholarship lift his efforts entirely above the level of the
  usual endeavor to teach Biblical and Christian history by means of
  fiction.”

       + =Ind.= 63: 575. S. 5, ’07. 210w.

  “The book is interesting; it is ably written; it is in parts striking;
  and yet one feels that somehow it misses effect as a whole. And we
  think that the reason is obvious. Dr. Abbott in writing it had two
  diverse ends in view and each interfered with the other.”

  its argument where the writer has been carried away by his own pet
  theories.”

  “As to whether he has succeeded or failed in his religious purpose his

  think, however that those who are most convinced of his theologic
  failure will not deny him a literary success. He has written a deeply
  interesting theological book in the form of a story.”

  In Miss Abbott’s rambles one may live over again the delights of many
  of New England’s quaint byways. “She has caught the spirit of New
  England, and introduces incidentally curious and charming
  out-of-the-way places, historic spots, Indian legends and New England
  folklore.” (Ind.)

  Eleven essays are included here whose keynote is sounded in the first,
  “Three kinds of happiness.” “There are three kinds of happiness,” says
  Dr. Abbott, “pleasure, joy, blessedness. Pleasure is the happiness of
  the animal nature; joy, of the social nature; blessedness, of the
  spiritual nature. Pleasure we share with the animals, joy with one
  another, blessedness with God.”

  A very illuminating introduction shows that Jesus resorted to the
  parable to allay the wrath which his plain truth-teaching had stirred
  up against him. “He veiled the truth which unveiled had been rejected
  with such wrath, and he did so that they might listen to him without
  perceiving the truth to which they would refuse to listen if they did
  perceive it.” The scriptural version of the parables follows, with a
  well-executed illustration here and there suggesting the modern
  prodigal, the modern foolish virgin and the present-day house builded
  upon the sand, etc.

  How did the old masters produce their results? How have these results
  defied time and atmospheric changes? Twenty-five years of study have
  been devoted to these questions by the author and “he has proved to
  his own, and we may say, to our satisfaction, that the great Venetians

  Mr. Ade’s “pastures new” are chiefly in London and Egypt. He
  characterizes humorously without his usual slang. “The foibles and

  The slim Princess Kalora of Morovenia is the despair of her father and
  fat younger sister because there is a Turkish law which reads that the
  elder must marry first and there is a Turkish preference for fat
  wives. Kolora is not only slim but spirited and she merrily takes her
  destiny into her own hands and, assisted by a kindly Fate, succeeds in
  marrying a venturesome young Pittsburgh millionaire. The story is

  discovered, and driven to attribute such effect to some agency outside
  the world of sense, I reach at length the inevitable conclusion that
  there is a world of which this physical process came, upon which it
  rests, by which it is energetically sustained; in a word, that the

  nearing seventy years, Deborah, his child wife, and a young English

  from the work of the publishers—the accuracy and detail of the

  the earlier volumes and seem, therefore, likely to characterize the

  inevitable in a narrative devoid of the above mentioned qualities by
  constant recourse to the phraseology of others or to awkward

  examination of the materials in the class-room. His work differs from
  the well-known source-books in that it consists of excerpts from the
  secondary sources only: e. g., Maitland, Freeman, and Stubbs.
  Thirty-six authors are represented and a larger number of works. The
  difficulty of making a wise selection from abundant materials is

  “The Ghost” by the author of the fantastic “Hugo” “is an exciting
  story of opera singers and railway accidents and channel-boat
  disasters and trapdoors and revenge and jealousy that is strong enough
  to be carried beyond death, and of love that triumphs even over such
  fatal jealousy.”—Acad.

  One feels that Mr. Bennett fairly slaps his canvas with a Kipling
  brush of comet’s hair. The result is a fantastic, panoramic
  “improvisation.” “Hugo is proprietor of an immense shop in London. He
  falls in love with a milliner in one of his innumerable ‘departments.’
  She weds another, is pursued by a third, officially dies, is bereft
  timely of her spouse, and returns in due season to life and Hugo.”

  give English readers as intelligible a narrative as that enjoyed by

  mystified where the Russian finds himself enlightened. When in his old

  principally to attend the “great Durbar” at Delhi. “She reckons and
  guesses with equal aplomb, and has certain idioms of her own
  invention, such as ‘I don’t catch right on to the people straight
  away,’ and ‘Say, though, I’m shying off the main point,’ not to speak

  from being a failure, this novel contains so much knowledge of
  character, and such a light and sure touch in the sketching of passing
  personalities, that we regret the trivialities which condemn it to a

=Briggs, Charles Augustus, and Hugel, Friedrich H. von.= Papal
commission and the Pentateuch. *75c. Longmans.

  In which the author and his friend Friedrich von Hugel exchange
  letters on the decision of the Pontifical commission concerning the
  Pentateuch. Professor Briggs expresses his “surprise and grief that
  the Commission should have put such a burden on the church, and
  restates the critical conclusions as to the composite authorship of
  the Pentateuch, as against the Commission’s conclusion that Moses
  wrote it, with the use of pre-existing documents and some later
  scribal additions. Von Hugel replies, defining the liberty of Catholic
  scholarship in the church, agreeing with Professor Briggs as to the
  folly of the Commission’s action, even altho approved by the Pope, and
  both agree that the decision should not forbid critical research and
  freedom.” (Ind.)

  Sir Elyot Ingall of Ingalton, young, handsome, and on the eve of a
  literary career, finds his estates hopelessly encumbered and is
  obliged to let his manor house and strive by personal effort to keep a
  mortgage off his Dower woods, the woods he loves, the trees of which
  offer the only source of revenue for him. He struggles against the
  woodman’s axe and finds inspiration for his writings in his forest.
  When thru a legal tangle it is all but lost to him he recovers it, and
  in recovering learns that the girl he loved and trusted had played the
  trees false and planned to sacrifice them for the gold she craved. In
  his agony his heart returns to his first love thru whom he and his

  years 1813 and 1815, and the author does not claim therein to bring to
  light new facts, but to summarize the results of other people’s
  researches. His book, is, however, more valuable than might be

  with some good portrayals of men and women most closely identified

  relation between that continent and Great Britain. “The bond is not
  one that has grown strong by reason of political adjustments or of
  commercial necessities. Its virtue consists in the fact that it has
  not been manufactured in the mills of diplomacy. The more it is
  tampered with, the weaker it becomes. It is made of impalpable
  materials—of such materials as memory, sentiment, self-abnegation,
  heredity, pride. To attempt to trim it in one place and to buttress it

  elect of the England and America of today. Reuben Vanderpoel of New
  York has added greatly to the millions his father wrested from the new
  world, and his two daughters carry that wealth to the old world to
  re-build two fine old English estates. The elder daughter, Rosie, is
  the victim of a dissipated fortune-hunter who abuses her and neglects
  his property. It is left for her sister, Bettina, the best product of
  American birth and European schools, to come to her rescue twelve
  years later with a clear head and a large bank account. While at work
  upon this task she finds that all poor noblemen are not mercenary and

=Calvert, Albert Frederick.= Alhambra of Granada. *$15. Lane.

  The history which forms the background of this volume covers the
  Moslem rule from the reign of Mohammed to the expulsion of the Moors.
  “The Alhambra or the Red castle, will ever, in spite of its lamentable
  state of decay, take first rank, on account of the combined beauty and
  variety of its ornamentation, and the thrilling memories with which it
  is associated.... The author lays great stress in the preface to his
  first edition on the fact that he has given pride of place to the
  pictorial side of his volume, making his chief appeal to the public by
  the beauty and variety of the illustrations he has collected, which
  include nearly 500 reproductions in black-and-white of details of
  architecture, and over 100 in colour of typical decoration.” (Int.

  “The author was apparently in too great haste to attend much to the

  mixed up indiscriminately, and extraordinary language is indulged in.
  Most of it is fairly good, and the characterizations of public men are
  at times excellent. But the arrangement is poor and detail is usually
  put in where uncalled for; the disjointed sections give little
  impression of continuity and do not make clear the general
  development; nothing stands out in bold relief.” Victor Coffin.

  Jealousy incites Howard Van Courtland to murder his business partner.
  Malcolm, a young clerk in their employ, is accused and the story is
  mainly concerned with the trial in which Van Courtland’s daughter,
  learning of her father’s guilt, is bent upon clearing Malcolm. She
  draws information from the prosecuting attorney and passes it on to
  the defendant’s counsel, all of which finally proves of no avail until
  in a dramatic court-room scene the father confesses his guilt and dies
  suddenly. In the end misunderstandings are adjusted and love wins a
  hard fought battle.

  Historical and traditional allusions, the sentiment and superstitions,

  A group of Russian peasants among Alaskan snows enact here a drama
  impossible in its primitive passions to a more conventional setting.
  The wife of Luka dies in the first chapter, and he, crazed by her
  loss, wanders away to search for her. He fancies he has found her in
  his brother’s promised bride, wins her love, is wounded in the quarrel
  with his brother for her possession, and awakes after an illness to a
  realization that she is not the much loved wife he has lost. How these
  two souls so oddly met, so strangely bound together, work out their
  own happiness is the story of the book.

  Mark Twain’s viewpoint is an objective one, humorously critical and
  one which characterizes the Christian science faith in the light of a
  reversal of the very things which to its followers are possible. He
  counts Christian science among the religions of the insane, and
  considers Mrs. Eddy in the light of a self-deified mental despot,
  which picture is drawn from the author’s interpretation of her acts

  The unpleasant story of Queen Caroline, the much disliked wife of
  George IV. is given in detail in this volume. “To speak of her in the
  words of the romantic and attractive title of this book as ‘a queen of
  indiscretions’ is to put her case very leniently indeed. Knowing that
  scandalmongers were constantly busy with her name, she deliberately
  did whatever a mind remarkably fertile in expedients could devise to
  make herself talked about the more. Finally she left England and spent
  six years trailing her little court ... all over Europe and even into
  Asia. Much of this time she spent in Italy. And it is to the records
  of her stay in that country that Signor Clerici has especially devoted
  himself in the preparation of this book.... The illustrations are

  This volume by “the well-known supporter of Mr. Chamberlain and
  president of the Rural laborers’ league ... opens with a discussion of
  the principles of the purchase of land bills, introduced into the
  house of commons by the author two years ago. Next follow seven
  excellent chapters containing a fairly full history of the origin and
  growth of the present English land system, and particularly of the
  gradual disappearance of peasant proprietorship. Lastly, a third
  division of nine chapters sets forth the arguments for and against the
  various proposals which have been made for the revival of British
  agriculture and the encouragement of small holdings.”—Nation.

  In an introductory essay on “The education of an artist,” Mr. Cox
  compares the education afforded by the apprenticeship custom of the
  renaissance with that obtainable in the modern art schools and
  studios. Following this chapter are six, as follows: The Pollaiuoli,
  Painters of the mode, Holbein, The Rembrandt tercentenary, Rodin and

  A three-part work on economics illuminated by the thought “that the
  symbol of a revolving wheel is the natural symbol of the reproduction
  of wealth, and that the laws of the increase and decrease of wealth,
  as well as the immediate deduction therefrom, must be identical with,
  and so be transferable from the mathematics of a mechanical wheel of
  wealth and the science of political economy.” Part 1, treats of
  “Reconstruction;” Part 2, “Free trade and protection;” Part 3, surveys
  the “Critical and historical” aspects of the subjects, passing under
  review the English and foreign schools.

  “So thoroughly is political economy ‘reconstructed’ in this modest
  volume, that we fail to recognize the battered, though regenerated,
  science. The book is as disproportioned as a monster. Vital economic
  problems are completely disregarded, other questions are treated at
  excessive length.”

  “Dr. Crozier possesses a bright and generally intelligible, though

  “Eliminate the wheel; moderate the oratorical rush of the writer;

  which really obscure, and metaphors which are none the less

  Crozier’s mistakes. It is only fair to say that the ‘Wheel of wealth,’

  A comprehensive review of the work of this famous Italian draughtsman
  meets a definite need. “One of Miss Cruttwell’s main objects has been
  to draw a clear distinction between the two brothers Antonio and
  Piero, whose works are commonly classed together and whom ordinarily
  well-informed persons find it difficult to separate in their minds....

=Dale, Robert W.= History of English Congregationalism. **$4. Armstrong.

  A book by one of England’s most commanding nonconformists which is
  written for Congregationalists but which will interest “Episcopalians
  and Presbyterians especially, as well as all Americans to whom the
  development of religious freedom and the delimitation of the spheres
  of church and state form an attractive subject.” (Outlook.) “He tells
  the life-history of a cause which suffered contempt and cruel
  oppression, and of which he was the latest—and the most
  eloquent—exponent.... So much only of political history is given as is
  absolutely necessary for his purpose.” (Ath.)

  memory; but it must not be forgotten that without another’s labour it
  would never have seen the light. The manner in which the work of
  arrangement, of revision, of completion, and of illustration has been
  performed by his son demands separate, if brief recognition. In

  denounce and defy it; his self-chosen part is that of the upsetter of
  all equanimities, the denier of all commonly accepted creeds,
  conventions, and traditions.” (Lond. Times.) “The very title of the
  book is manifold in its meaning. Life is a holiday, and the holiday of
  holidays is the final liberty torn by the spirit out of its material
  servitudes.” (Ath.)

  “It is evident that what he lacks mostly is discipline and that
  austerity and economy of language which go with it. The fault looks
  straight out of the verse, and it is equally noticeable in his essay,
  which rambles over the whole universe of thought, touching on many
  things of which Mr. Davidson speaks with no authority and yet
  containing many interesting and suggestive things. Here we have
  extravagance both of thought and expression. It is the outpouring of

  Mr. Davidson tells in these six lectures what the poem has come to
  mean to him, and has sought to lay bare its “philosophical or ethical
  skeleton.” Speaking of the poem, he says: “Its content, I believe, is
  the entire spiritual movement toward individual emancipation, composed
  of the Teutonic reformation and the Italian Renaissance in all their
  history, scope, and consequences.”

  view, and is not merely a gathering from the opinions of previous
  critics and commentators; while its defects arise, to some extent at
  least, from this very quality of independence. However, many of Mr.
  Davidson’s ideas are interesting, and some of his remarks on single

  have been in the poet’s mind. It holds the reader’s interest from

=Davidson, William L.= Stoic creed. *$1.75. Scribner.

  “The book is divided into three main ‘sections,’ followed by an

  ‘Moulding influences and leaders of the school,’ and shows how
  stoicism is mainly derived, on its ethical side, from the impulse of
  Socrates and the sophists. The second section, on ‘Stoic science and
  speculation,’ contains chapters dealing with the conception of
  philosophy, the logic and epistemology, the physics and cosmology, of
  the school, concluding with a chapter on the atomic theory of Epicurus
  in its relation to stoicism. The third section has for its title
  ‘Morality and religion,’ and occupies about half the book. It
  contains, in addition to a detailed exposition of the ethical system
  and its relation to cynicism, some useful pages of criticism, in which
  the defects of the system are indicated; and an interesting chapter
  entitled ‘Present-day value of stoicism,’ in which the dicta of
  eminent moderns, such as M. Arnold and Renan, concerning the stoic
  moralists are examined and appreciated.”—Ath.

  This piece of historical fiction deals with the invasion of Greece by
  the Persians under Xerxes. Altho many of the characters are fictitious
  and the love story is purely imaginary, the scenes are apparently true
  to the times, and Athens and Sparta are made to tremble before the
  invader as history tells us they trembled, while her heroes of the
  hour play the glorious parts which history says they played. Perhaps
  the best chapters are those descriptive of Thermopylae and Salamis.

=Dawson, Alec J.= The message. †$1.50. Estes.

  A novel with a purpose which presumes to command a 1940 view point.
  “His standpoint is frankly imperial, and even partisan. He assumes
  that the trend of the present government is towards weakness and
  sentimentalism and the neglect of national interests; and from that
  postulate he has developed a pretty pickle for the country it governs.
  The Germans land in force on the coasts of East Anglia, and in an
  almost incredibly short time Great Britain is at their mercy.
  Thereafter comes the rebuilding—the re-edification which is implied in
  the title. This tack is initially undertaken by Canadian preachers,
  and indeed the entire regeneration comes from the colonies.” (Ath.)

  The lonely lady is a pretty country bred girl of twenty-five who comes
  to Grosvenor square as the guest of a great-aunt and stays there after
  her aunt’s death to watch over the estate which is an inheritance of
  her twin brother who is in active service in Africa. The account of
  how she tries to do honor to her name and position by following the
  social code of her country rector’s wife, and how from the dull
  loneliness of London state and formality she is rescued by her distant
  cousin the Duke, forms a pretty old fashioned love story.

  her side a protector, who, a little later, when the drunk-sodden
  parents die, rescues her from the basement of an old house in Soho and
  places her in the care of his sister. The chief interest of the tale
  lies in the development of the child in intimate portrayal, the simple
  life-likeness of characters, and the sure tho delayed consummation of
  the romance. There are ghosts and mysteries in the plot which seems to
  be a sensitive conscience’s concession to the veteran novel-reader

  Dr. Densmore’s theories are based upon the teachings of Darwin,
  Spencer, and modern exponents of the doctrine of evolution. The book
  teaches that women are more intuitive, refined, unselfish and
  spiritual than men, but are inferior to them in initiative, resource,
  power and breadth of view; that these mental differences are not
  fundamental nor the result of sex but are caused by environment and
  heredity. The book makes a strong plea for extending democracy into
  all phases of human life.

  Dillenius, and has critically examined the specimens preserved as

  Set in England this story with its tangled threads and continuous
  action shows how an inheritance proved a pitfall. A naive,
  unconscionable girl marries the gouty old Sir Peter—of a less
  irascible temperament, tho in many points not unlike Sheridan’s Sir
  Peter—and does it to save herself from the battle for bread. After the
  sudden death of Sir Peter a daughter is born, and the mother, finding
  that the bulk of the estate had been willed to a nephew, begins a long
  series of sham proceedings which, to hold the property for herself,
  require that the child be brought up as a boy. At sixteen the child
  takes things into her own hands, apparently drowns, reappears as a
  twin sister who, so the fiction ran, had for family reasons been sent
  to California in infancy, restores to the cousin his property, falls
  in love with this cousin, and, heart-broken because it is not returned
  and because she has all thru life served only as her mother’s tool,
  drowns herself. Plot and counter-plot abound.

  The symbolism which abounds in this book reminds one of Ibsen. A
  little boy seeks diligently from fairy guides a solution to the riddle
  of the universe and its manifold manifestations. As he grows older his
  desire for understanding is no less keen but for the fairy thoughts of
  imagination are substituted the troll-ideas of grotesque human
  realities. Finally among the sordid commonplaces he falls in with a
  companion who is a “modern reincarnation of the Christ.” There is a
  very human love tale, the romance of the imaginative Johannes and
  Marjon, a little circus girl.

  The bicentenary of John Evelyn’s death has served to produce some good
  reprints of his diary. This one edited by Mr. Dobson contains an
  informing biographical introduction and helpful notes. “Its long
  chronicle extends over an unbroken period of more than sixty years,
  dating from the stormy days which preceded the Commonwealth to the
  early time of Queen Anne. During all this age—‘an age,’ as his epitaph
  puts it, ‘of extraordinary events and revolutions’—Evelyn was quietly,
  briefly, methodically noting what seemed to him worthy of remembrance.
  His desire for knowledge was insatiable, his sympathies wide, and his
  tastes catholic.”

  white lies closes about her, her much enduring husband ceases to

  The action of this novel, filled with a strange mixture of spiritual
  discernment, theories of reincarnation, and the idea of the vendetta,
  takes place at a castle hermitage owned by the count Caesar d’Ormengo.
  There falls to the count the care of a beautiful niece Mariana, morbid
  in fancies and self-analysis. She learns from a secret compartment in
  her escritoire that she is the reincarnation of an ancestor who went
  mad in those very walls because of inhuman treatment, and who commands
  that the one whose eyes shall fall upon the memorandum of her agony
  find the way for revenge. Involved in the scheme of vendetta are the
  count, Corrodo Silla, a young secretary whose life is linked to
  Mariana’s as the reincarnated lover, a German secretary and his
  daughter. The story waxes horrible as Mariana executes her mission of
  vengeance: she causes the death of the count, kills Silla and drowns
  herself. But through all is inexorable fate, to which, not conscious
  of her own power to baffle it, she yields.

  David Rivers is wrested from his young love-making by old Robert
  Henley, a self-constituted guardian, and is sent away to develop a
  promising literary talent. The success and failure of an impersonally

  David left behind is the embodiment of the strong love motif of the
  tale while Violet Winter, the fascinating New York woman whom he
  marries, is the stumbling block. Violet contemplates full reparation
  to David in allowing a threatening disease to go unoperated upon. How

  religious idea of the death and resurrection of the God is clear and

  “A book for the student and practicing engineer which contains a
  discussion of steam turbines and principles, and early steam turbine
  patents. “A number of chapters give detailed descriptions of all the
  important turbines now in use in this country and in Europe.” Then
  follow chapters upon Steam and its properties, Notes on efficiency and
  design. The commercial aspect of the turbine, Care and management,
  Condensing apparatus for high vacuum.... The last chapter of the book
  treats of the Marine turbine.” (Engin. N.)

  “The book will never be popular in America, it is safe to say, for
  several reasons. It is, like a German sentence, long-winded, involved,
  and cumbrous. ‘Holyland’ contains several passages which make it unfit
  for the youthful, and even many older readers will find them
  offensive. And because we are in a very different stage of theological
  thought from Germany, the religious purpose of the novel will fail to
  arouse either the enthusiasm or the antagonism that it has in
  Germany.”

  “An every-day sort of story of ordinary life in Germany. At the
  opening of the book the three comrades are three 10–year-old boys in
  the days of the Franco-German war. Later they are carried on into
  manhood, they separate, and each goes his own way. After a time each
  is so hampered by his faults of character that he is on the brink of
  failure. Then, at the crisis of their misfortune, they are reunited
  and together they are able to avert the threatened disaster.” (N. Y.

  our spiritual consciousness.’ It will forsake the ‘incessant

  A brief story which is an exaltation of sensuous fascination into an
  affair of the soul and which casts the moral law to the four winds of
  heaven. A titled young Englishman is sent away from home to be cured
  of his love for a rural English girl with red hands. In Paris he meets
  and falls in love with the queen of a Russian dependency, “infinitely
  sinuous and attractive” who is residing at his hotel incognito. They
  yield entirely to the sway of their love which the author’s art aims
  to transform into the poetry of sentiment. They suffer the agony of it

  “This valuable work by Dr. Goss covers the very important field of
  locomotive steam engineering from a standpoint that prior to the
  development of the engineering laboratory at Purdue university was
  never possible. Dr. Goss has combined in this volume the most
  important results obtained from the Purdue tests, records of which
  have from time to time been separately published, together with other
  material never before published, thereby making a ‘permanent and
  accessible record of the work of the laboratory.’”—Engin. N.

  The “struggle between two temperaments” forms the subject-matter of
  this volume relating to Edmund Gosse and his father. The offspring of
  parents married late in life, the boy grows up in an atmosphere
  heavily charged with extreme English Puritanism. “When the child’s
  ‘temperament’ began to develop, it displayed itself as a passionate
  attachment to the romantic in art and poetry; and there were infinite
  possibilities of discord between a father who, though he enjoyed
  declaiming the sonorous lines of Virgil and Milton, prided himself on
  never having read a page of Shakespeare, and a son who saved up his
  pocket money to buy the poems of Coleridge and Keats, and, on one
  occasion, Christopher Marlowe.” (Lond. Times.)

  much unlike those of other children, but told with all the skill of an
  accomplished man of letters.”

  century as the setting for his story of Hyla, the serf, whom he has
  made typical of serfdom, and within whose misshapen body burned the
  first spark of freedom which was to enkindle the world. The coarse
  times are well depicted from the lewd life of the barons in their
  castles to the hopeless routine of the serfs in their shacks. The
  personality of Hyla who rises from the herd about him and becomes a
  man and a murderer to avenge his daughters and his wrongs, is strongly
  brought out and the reader follows breathless until he has paid the
  awful price exacted from such as he.

  Set in the times of the Tudors, this tale is one of daring adventure
  by land and sea. “It involves the slaughter of a retainer of the
  Spanish ambassador in the opening scene, and the escape of an
  Anglo-Jewish merchant from the Spanish inquisition in the last. The
  fortunes of the Jew’s daughter—who has been abducted, by a nobleman in
  the train of De Ayala, the ambassador, and is pursued across the sea
  by her lover, brave Peter Brome, and his comrades—form the main thread

  The author of “The autobiography of a thief” offers in this volume a
  first hand study of the life of a Chicago labor leader and trade
  unionist. After a long search Mr. Hapgood found a German who, both as
  a type and a person, combined the desired temperament, character and
  experience for his impressionistic study. Born in Germany, Anton came
  to America as a child, shifted much of the time for himself, lived
  thru the various stages of tramp life, rural, sordid conditions,
  worked off and on at odd jobs, finally married and settled down in
  Chicago as a wood-worker. His quick intelligence discovered the
  injustice of organised society on every hand and led him to the basic
  principles of radicalism with which the book deals.

  troops from the south; nine to twelve discuss silver coinage and the
  national civil service; thirteen and fourteen discuss the Isthmian

  administration of 1884 found, Professor Dewey traces the course of the
  national problems to 1897. He deals with organized labor, civil
  service, the tariff, silver, railroads, foreign relations, the

  Only a portion of Professor Heller’s contemplated treatise was
  completed before his death. This part includes probably half of what
  the work was to comprise. “It covers the principles of statical

  flexure vary from those expressed in the commonly-used formulas, and
  remarks on fatigue action and on the elastic properties of iron and

  In this novel the white man plays but a small part. It is a story of
  the Indian of to-day, of the hunters of the Hudson bay country, and it
  tells of their life, their adventures, their superstitions, and their
  customs; closing like the conventional romance with the marriage of a
  young brave and an Indian maiden according to the rites of their
  tribe.

  Two young huntresses face lions and leopards in the African wilds as
  unflinchingly as any toughened game-bagger of the sterner sex. They go
  for game and adventure, and find it. Their caravan consisted of
  forty-nine camels, seven horses, about a half hundred camel drivers,
  men of all work and guides. There is a thrill on almost every page to
  keep the adventure-lover’s blood tingling.

  To free her lover from an insane asylum, a young heiress searches out
  his double, offers him ample remuneration to assume insanity, become
  an inmate of the asylum, exchange places with the lover and help the
  latter to escape. The one feigning insanity finds the other too

  for the man shut away in the “refractory cell” but which in reality
  menaces the life and happiness of the innocent double. The tangle is

  output of gold will increase rapidly; second, that, therefore, a
  depreciation in the value of gold will inevitably result.... Like
  several books, which have appeared during the past few years, the

  Instead of marrying a shallow-minded girl with a two-hundred-thousand
  dollar dowery, Roy Marshall chooses to wed his sister’s governess, a
  girl whose literary career had been checked by her father’s loss of
  money and subsequent death. From an unsuccessful beginning in life on
  a New York paper his course is turned into the channel of Pittsburg
  steel interests and he rises to a multi-millionaire’s position of
  prominence and power. The loose morals that result in his abandoning
  and divorcing his wife are astonishingly at variance with his early
  integrity; he pays a heavy penalty, and the book has a moral.

  the things of life, Brooke looked the peer squarely in the eye and

  Fragments of the Arthurian legends which are presented for the sake of

  picturesque value as poetic material or for the sake of their glamour
  and romance. From notes, jottings, and outlines set down in note books

=Howard, Newman.= Christian trilogy. 3v. ea. *$1.25. Dutton.

  “Religions may come and go; the forms of morality may change, and what
  is right in one age and clime be wrong in another; but the essential
  virtue remains the same—nothing else than faithfulness to what a man
  holds to be right. That is the idea running through the three plays
  which Mr. Newman Howard calls his ‘Christian trilogy.’... Kiartan was,
  externally, true to his false friend; Savonarola to his false city;
  Minervina and Crispus, Constantine’s discarded wife and son, to their
  false husband, wife, and emperor. In each case there lies behind the
  occasion, the sense of honor, the conviction of the necessity for
  truth to an ideal of right.”—Lond. Times.

  drama. Mr. Howard’s work is so fine that it seems captious to point
  out what we feel to be a defect in it. Though in each of his dramas,
  tragedy is implied in the character of the chief personage, too much
  of the action is controlled by the persistent malignity of another
  individual. Free from most of the tricks of the playwright, Mr. Howard
  still relies too much on his villain.”

  =v. 2.= Savonarola: a city’s tragedy.

  Execution.”

                  *       *       *       *       *

  “Without any sacrifice of dramatic propriety he has so arranged that
  you see not only people but their surroundings. As a result, the play
  is full of the stir and colour of mediaeval Italy. Indeed, though he
  has handled the central theme in a masterly manner, what will delight
  most readers is the extraordinary sense of atmosphere created by the
  minor characters.”

  “In ‘Savonarola,’ Mr. Howard’s more recent drama, the lack of sharp
  definition in the plot and dialogue is much more apparent than in
  ‘Kiartan,’ since all the rival factions and orders, civil and
  religious, of that turbulent period are represented in the play and by
  their machinations so involve the plot that it is difficult to keep
  the various characters and their allegiance distinct.” Jessie B.

  The establishment of Christianity as the state religion of the Roman
  empire furnishes the key-note of the third part of the trilogy. “In
  this play Mr. Howard gets his background, his atmosphere, mainly by a
  single figure; that of the little degenerate Fabius. By an almost
  savage piece of irony, Fabius is made the victim of the plot to murder
  Constantine. The state of paganism at the period of the play is
  admirably indicated by the priests of Demeter with their pitiful
  machinery for working an apparition of the goddess Proserpine. Bombo
  is one of the best clowns out of Shakespeare.” (Acad.)

  the great.’ The chief characters stand out with something of the
  objective reality of sculpture but with all the life and movement of
  human beings. The dialog is reduced to its bare essentials, and
  because no word is allowed for its own sake, every word is not only
  significant but decorative, so that the texture of the verse is as if

  Of the seven tales told by old friends at the club four are
  psychological romances, stories of that mental borderland suggested by
  the book’s title. “A sleep and a forgetting” tells of a strange lapse
  of memory in a young girl; “The eidolons of Brooks Alford” concerns
  the visions of a broken down professor and the pretty widow who
  disperses them; “A memory that worked over time” is a confusion of
  memory and imagination; and “A case of metaphantasmia” enters into the
  question of dream-transference. The three stories which conclude the
  book, “Editha,” “Braybridge’s offer,” and “The chick of the Easter
  egg” are plain day-light stories, a protest against war, a speculation
  as to the average proposal, and an amusing Easter comedy.

  Part 1 of this sociological story contains a view of modern New York
  as seen by a traveler from Altruria. The tall, bleak apartment houses,
  the social distinctions, and the greed for gain impress him so
  strongly that he says at the very outset,—“If I spoke with Altrurian
  breath of the way New Yorkers live, I should begin by saying that the
  New Yorkers do not live at all.” Part 2 contains an account of
  Altruria as seen by the American wife whom he takes home with him, and
  who has a difficult time adjusting her American ideas to a country
  which has neither money nor social gradations, and, where lord and
  farmer work happily for their living, side by side.

  knights and the heroine is an Inca princess for love of whom
  Christoval fights against his own army. Barbaric splendor and Spanish
  chivalry combine in producing splendid dramatic coloring.

  observations and experiences all characterized by the vague sense of
  mystery surrounding an untamed, unused and unnourished stretch of
  country. There is a wealth of pictures attending his sketch of rivers
  and mountains, cañons and springs, life and history.

  A series of twenty volumes entitled “Original narratives of early
  American history,” undertaken under the auspices of the American
  historical society and edited by J. F. Jameson. “The series is to
  consist of such volumes as will illustrate the early history of all
  the chief parts of the country, with an additional volume of general
  index. The plan contemplates, not a body of extracts, but in general
  the publication or the republication of whole works or of distinct
  parts of works.” (N. Y. Times.)

  This first volume of the series is divided into three parts: “The
  voyages of the Northmen,” edited by Professor J. E. Olson, which
  presents the saga in Hauksbok and that in Flatey-jarbok, together with
  some minor Northern and papal pieces; “The voyages of Columbus” and
  “The voyages of John Cabot,” edited by Professor E. G. Bourne.

  “This volume includes the contemporary accounts of the three most
  important Spanish explorations in the region now comprised in the
  southern part of the United States. These are Cabeza de Vaca’s
  narrative of his remarkable wanderings, the account of the expedition
  of Hernando de Soto by the gentleman of Elvas, and Pedro de
  Castaneda’s narrative of the expedition of Coronado. Apart from the
  requirements of the series there was not the same necessity for the

  A clear-cut western girl with crudities of heredity, training and

  upon the edge of conventional society. She is twenty-six and possesses
  the integrity of a man. She falls in love with a youth of twenty who
  is loyal in spite of the determination of his little fashionable set
  to end his infatuation. The story dwells upon the mother’s cruel
  scheme of flicking the girl upon the raw by inviting her to an
  exclusive house party, counting her son’s disillusionment as a result
  of the gulf which she will spare no pains to make apparent. Clem rises
  phoenix-like from the fire of her persecution and shames the
  persecutor’s snobbishness by means of her heroic sense of honor quite

  A bank robbery and the search for and discovery of the robber form the
  plot of this novel which, contrary to the usual detective story,
  hinges upon the love of the heroine for the guilty man who has become
  her husband, and whom she raises to her own level by the help of her
  Catholic faith. It is really a tale of regeneration through love,
  altho much of the book is concerned with the unravelling of a mystery

  His love-making is interrupted when he embarks for America and becomes
  closely identified with the fortunes of Captain John Smith. “The story
  chronicles the career of the latter, his rescue at the hands of

  the face of jealous opposition and treachery, the injuries which
  forced him to return to England, and the ghastly winter of bloodshed

  Paul Trafford, the giant of the tale, is a rich coal king. The forcing
  process that has made him a monopolist has been sheltered behind the
  law, and when the necessary laws did not exist he bought legislatures
  to pass them. The machinery of his system crushes one Roger Winship
  whose family is a living judgment upon Trafford’s methods and success.
  The dramatic element and the strong ethical lesson are to be found in
  the romance which springs up between the daughter of Trafford and
  Roger Winship’s son, both of whom are ready to renounce their life
  happiness for the principle which renders it impossible for young
  Winship to accept one penny of Trafford’s wealth.

  Desiring to learn details of the fate of two members of his family who
  fell in the civil war, a northerner makes his first journey into the

  representatives of the very highest class of southern society. The aim
  of the story seems to be that of modifying a northerner’s abhorrent
  attitude toward the system of slavery by dropping him into
  surroundings where master and negro alike are bred to the chivalry of
  the “quality.”

  The women of a northern New England town are seized with the spirit of
  club organization and the “Morning glory club” is the result. General
  improvement, a definite force for good in the town seem to be their
  theoretical watchwords yet they go far afield for bits of gossip to
  retail indiscriminately at their meetings. An equally gossipy group of
  husbands in the background, a village parson who believes that the
  club is the devil’s own disguise, a charming young school teacher,
  misunderstood and much maligned, and the parson’s son, dismissed from
  college for his pranks, furnish some of the personalities with which
  the story deals. Comic as well as tragic happenings abound, but all
  ends well amid wholesome reform and reconciliation.

  discovers the spark of histrionism in her, but who discourages an
  ambitious aunt in starting the child upon the long road to stage fame.
  Nevertheless the start is made, and the reader is given an intimate
  view of hardships that pave the way to success, of heartaches and
  struggles that lie just back of the footlights. The great charm of the
  story lies in the unsullied freshness with which Felicity emerges from
  her developing process against odds to grace the high places in her

  “The interest of these volumes as a whole, apart from the feeling, and
  in many parts real inspiration and ‘élan,’ with which they are
  written, will probably be found in the comprehensiveness with which
  the problem of philosophy is grasped, and the sustained effort that is
  made to escape from the Scylla of the static or ‘stagnant’ Absolute
  without falling into the Charybdis of subjectivism and pluralism. In
  their own peculiar way they contain much that is helpful towards the
  restatement of idealism which is the chief philosophical requirement
  of the present time. Why this irritating form? It is not only that the
  second volume is merely a somewhat less technical restatement of the
  first, but in the argument of each there is endless repetition. For
  whom, again, is the book written? The uninitiated will find far too
  little; the initiated would be satisfied with much less; the
  positivist who could understand it if he would is not likely to
  persevere long in the attempt. But all this might be passed over if
  the writer had not made clear the point on which, as he rightly

  words when those of more general acceptance among philosophical
  writers would often have served his purpose equally well. These

  =v. 3.= The first two chapters of Mr. Lea’s third volume are upon
  “‘Torture’ and ‘The trial’ and complete his study of the practice of
  the Inquisition; five others, beginning with ‘The sentence’ and ending
  with ‘The auto de fé,’ cover what he has to tell us of its
  punishments; and the closing four, on ‘Jews,’ ‘Moriscos,’
  ‘Protestantism,’ and ‘Censorship,’ open that survey of its spheres of
  action which is to fill also most of his final volume.”—Am. Hist. R.

  =v. 4.= The author’s study of the Inquisition, brought to a close in
  this volume, results in the conclusion “that its work was almost
  wholly evil, and that, through reflex action, the persecutor suffered
  along with the persecuted.” The volume deals with curious phases of
  doctrine and superstition prevalent at that time, such as sorcery and
  the occult arts, witchcraft, Jansenism and the varied political and
  social conditions which fostered not only the Inquisition itself but
  the tendencies that it was intended to combat.

  is woven a double thread of mystery in the persons of a white swathed
  figure which haunts a young American art student and a demented

  Over the story of John Smith the author has thrown the glamour of
  romance. He has written a historical novel in which all that is
  history and all that is novel is alike familiar to our ears. It is a
  tribute to this early hero which will help to keep him before a coming
  generation as a man, a gentleman and an adventurer.

  Her ungovernable temper sends her to the reform school, she escapes,
  but is persuaded by a clean, strong young artist rusticating in

  forth with a clear record, and enters the maelstrom of shopgirl life

  A novel which embodies a satire on the medical profession whose aim is
  to disgust people with doctors and medicine. “Mr. Maartens gives us no
  inkling of what we are to do without doctors, but one of his
  characters whose legs have been mutilated in an accident is restored
  by faith. Several surgeons pronounce his case hopeless unless he will
  have both legs amputated. He refuses and is healed by prayer. Perhaps
  Mr. Maartens is an apostle of Faith healing or Christian science in
  disguise.” (Sat. R.)

  In the prologue of this drama the dramatist has imagined the players’
  quarter of a theatre of Herculaneum to be unearthed. An archaeologist
  present finds a papyrus scroll containing the players’ copy of “Sappho
  and Phaon.” The play presents Sappho created entirely from the bits of
  her verse that have been preserved. Among Sappho’s lovers are
  Pittacus, the Mitylene tyrant, and Alcaeus, while Sappho herself loves
  Phaon, a slave, who is bound to his slave mate Thalassa. Pittacus
  relinquishes his suit while Alcaeus persecutes Phaon. The tragedy
  grows out of these conditions, and into it are woven the traditional
  vengeance of the gods, with the modern note of symbolism and
  mysticism.

  “Prof. Mackenzie’s own humanism is described as ‘a point of view
  from which human life is regarded as an independent centre of
  interest’—as contrasted with a naturalism and supernaturalism which
  seek the explanation of human life either in the forces around man
  or in some powers distinct from man and those forces. In the light
  of that description the influence of humanism in philosophy,
  politics, economics, education, and religion is studied, and the two
  closing chapters examine the limitations and implications of
  humanism.”—Nature.

  “Prof. Mackenzie’s lectures provide excellent reading. The
  metaphysical expert is offered, in a final lecture, a few choice nuts
  to crack; whilst for the sociological expert—if, indeed, there is such
  a person, it matters less if the argument comes scarcely within bowing
  distance of him.”

  “In this volume, the chronological as opposed to the class division
  has been adopted, with the advantage of bringing its subject into a
  closer relation with history. The earliest brass is that of Sir John
  Daubernon at Stoke D’Abernon. This is dated 1277. Nineteen other
  examples belong to the next half-century, the latest but one being
  another Daubernon at the same place (1327). These are treated at
  length. The regular series begins with chap. 3. The Plantagenet,
  Lancastrian, Wars of the roses, and Tudor periods are successively
  dealt with. A chapter is given to the spoliation of the
  monasteries, ... and another to the Elizabethan revival. The
  illustrations are plentiful and excellent.”—Spec.

  “the theater of the most important events now taking place in the
  world.” It is an optimistic study, and the author “aims to explain
  those subterranean forces which seem to be raising the China of to-day
  from the bosom of the deep. Political agitation, whether periodic like
  the tides or unforeseen like the hurricane, is in general superficial
  and temporary, and the present reform movement in China, the author
  believes, has its root in forces more deep seated than such sporadic
  phenomena.” (N. Y. Times.)

  the waste of its fertile lands given up to rough pasture, wide hedges,
  and coppices carefully preserved for the sake of the game, while

  Prof. Meyer here resumes his study of the history of public ownership
  in Great Britain. It is a two-part story which the author tells of the
  British state telegraphs: the purchase of the telegraphs, in 1870,
  from the companies that had established the industry of telegraphy;
  and the subsequent conduct of the business of telegraphy by the
  government. “Both parts contain a record of fact and experience of
  importance to the American public at the present moment, when there is
  before them the proposal to embark upon the policy of the municipal
  ownership and operation of the so-called municipal public service
  industries.”

  Io, the Ganymede, and perhaps the Antiope. As the favored decorator of
  the provincial and by no means highly cultured court of Parma.

  An intimately analytical biography of Patrick Henry thruout which the

  This story opens upon a wintry afternoon in a district school house
  when a class reciting in “Green’s grammar” is interrupted by a tramp
  and his dog who beg shelter and warmth for an hour. The tramp finds
  among the pupils a kindred soul who one day joins the wanderer and
  casts in his lot with him. Their experiences end in the boy’s
  reforming the “bad man,” who in turn plans for the education of the
  lad whose mother had been his sweetheart and had found him unworthy.

  boasted power, and how concrete is the peril.” (N. Y. Times.)

  “Undoubtedly the facts presented by the author lead to the conclusion
  that the only effective method of securing that a land equally adapted
  for Europeans and Asiatics should be made a home for European settlers
  is that of almost total exclusion, adopted by Australia, joined to a
  fixed determination on the part of Europeans to engage in all forms of

  A stirring drama which involves the throne of Austria is here enacted
  among the Virginia hills just outside of Washington. The love story of
  the truly American heroine who, in spite of herself, follows her heart
  against her reason, and of the hero, heir to much Austrian greatness,
  who does his country service and then renounces all for the democratic
  life of an American, in itself holds the reader enthralled. But there
  are added to it many other interesting characters and some scenes of
  war and strategy, which will endear the book to lovers of adventure.

  A western girl as unconscious of her beauty as of her great wealth
  practices rigid economy during her four years at an Illinois college.
  The serenity of her wholly satisfactory life is interrupted by the
  co-executors of her estate, one a Chicago lawyer who wishes to marry
  her, the other a New York cousin who plans to take her east to be
  properly trained by wealthy relatives. She accepts the latter

  Written for the Longfellow centenary. The book “can be read through in
  less than two hours, and can be bought for less than a dollar; but
  neither of these facts should be of use in measuring the amount and
  duration of the impression it ought to make upon a receptive reader.
  The poems chosen number thirty, and include ‘A psalm of life,’ ‘The
  wreck of the Hesperus,’ ‘The bridge,’ ‘The cross of snow,’ and other
  favorites, concluding with ‘Morituri salutamus.’... Perhaps the most
  valuable point made by Mr. Norton is to be found in the paragraphs in
  which he shows how completely Longfellow was the product of a simple
  and refined New England, which had gently broken with the Puritan
  régime and was filled with an optimistic belief in the orderly
  evolution of men to individual and national felicity in a new and
  favored world. Purity, naturalness and kindness were the fundamental
  characteristics of Longfellow, and these were in the main, the
  fundamental characteristics of the people who first welcomed his

  wins the hand of the heroine in spite of the machinations of a titled

  the method of external observation ... and the method of inner
  reflection ... (2) a synthesis which, while it justifies the two
  methods revealed by the analysis, sets forth the necessity of a
  synthesis of them and an attempt to realize it; (3) a series of
  deductions, which might more properly be called corollaries, dealing
  with a number of themes of general philosophical interest.” (Nation.)

  The scenes of this series of novels are all laid in some city of the
  Old world vitally interesting from the standpoint of history. “Mr.
  Osborne has selected Perugia and the period of Vannucci Perugino as
  the place and time of his romance. The artist and his pupil,
  Raffaello. appear as characters, but mostly the tale is devoted to the

  Somewhat similar to “The wrecker” written by the author and his

  Schmidt is a stolid East-Side German shopkeeper. “The inner Schmidt

  “To tell the story of such a period so that its significance shall be
  plain to the uncritical reader requires evidently two gifts, of both
  of which Dr. Peck is possessed, the gift of analysing and picturing a

  of those social forces whose evolution may be recognized only after
  its results are accomplished—in short, to trace and describe ‘history
  in the making.’ Dr. Peck has also the gift of a lively narrative

  1806, with a crisp sketch of the armies, the leaders and the
  lieutenants on both sides, and gives a careful description of the
  topographical features of the difficult theatre of war—its marshes and
  forests, its mud and snow, its summer heat and winter tempests. Then
  follow the several operations, from that beginning in November and
  culminating in the battles of Pultusk and Golymin at Christmastide,
  1806, through the butchery of Eylau in February and its succeeding
  winter quarters, the siege of Danzig, and the ‘final triumph’ at
  Heilsburg and Friedland in June, 1807, followed by the treaty of

  case of one woman loved by three men and herself honestly loving two
  of the men and married to one of them. This must be admitted to be a

  A diary in the form of letters to his wife written by the chief
  engineer of the fleet from Aug. 28, 1904 to May 10, 1905. “It presents

  they must be, on an intimate knowledge of facts) on the character and

  which the reader will turn with added zest to the ‘facts’ of the

  Great Britain, pointing out the serious consequences of the
  indiscriminate pursuit of the system there. He says “Trading with the
  public credit, whether state or municipal, must, of necessity, lead to
  stupendous financial liabilities, add to the burden of the rates,
  weaken municipal credit, bring about inequality of taxation, interfere
  with the natural laws of trade, check industrial and scientific
  progress, stop invention, discourage individual effort, destroy
  foreign trade, establish an army of officials, breed corruption,
  create an aristocracy of labor, demoralize the voter, and ultimately
  make socialistic communities of towns and cities.”

  conducive to moral interests that there should be a conventional
  release from the remaining conventional bond.” (Outlook.) “The natural

  In the interests of psychology, to prove how great a part the
  conscience of a criminal plays in the detection of his crime, two

  died at a hospital for Dr. Horace, who promptly disappears on a two
  weeks’ vacation. They arrange the body so that murder is evident, they
  furnish a motive and every clue points to Wallace, the other man in

  Here is a story with a mystery surrounding the birth of an heir to a
  vast English estate. The moral law is sacrificed to the interests of
  ambition, and like many a modern story, no retribution follows for the
  offenders. The art of the story teller protects the mystery almost too
  well. The best character of the story is that of a faithful servant
  who served the house rather than individuals.

  In view of the Jamestown celebration special emphasis is here laid
  upon the part which it played in the birth of our nation. Beginning
  with the legends of early discoverers, the story of the colonization
  of Virginia is given briefly but with good detail, the men both white
  and red, who took active part in the struggle with the wilderness are
  vividly pictured in connection with the work they did. It is not a
  history of Jamestown, it is a history of the great movement which
  created Jamestown and preserved it, and it is a timely tribute to the
  town’s significance.

  special stress is laid upon the qualities of the man David, the
  frailties over which the might of character triumphed, the friendship
  for Jonathan, and the anguish and grief over Absalom. The character
  development is traced thru the experience of exile, thru the early
  years of opposition to his rule over the two tribes, and thru the
  years of prosperity and adversity as king over Israel.

  Provence.... Trillon, the hero, has a lordly disdain for
  commercialism.... We meet him ... fascinating the daughter of the
  inn-keeper by his audacious flattery, and after a courtship conducted
  with lightning rapidity in the teeth of every sort of opposition,
  going off to seek his fortune, while his betrothed is left to the
  untender mercies of her parents and the priest.... She enters a
  nunnery. But the irrepressible Trillon returns from the sea, abducts
  his betrothed ... sets himself to perform a labour of Hercules imposed
  by the priest as the condition of his consent to the marriage,—the
  conversion of a rocky wilderness known as the Pit of Artaban into a
  farm. Trillon’s exploits as a farmer ... make a most entertaining
  recital; and the final scene, in which he plays the part of a
  Provençal Lochinvar, brings a fantastic story to an appropriate
  close.”—Spec.

  Plot and action abound in this story of confused identity. In his
  college days, only four years past, the Reverend Harry Sanderson was
  known to his fellows as Satan Sanderson. There crosses his path one
  day an old associate, Hugh Stires, the degenerate son of St. James’
  richest parishioner, and so closely resembling Sanderson as to cause
  all the trouble that ensues. The ghosts of the past appear, but are
  downed by the invincible might of the young rector. The degenerate
  weds the woman Sanderson loves, proves unworthy of her, and throws
  himself upon Sanderson’s mercy, and the latter in attempting to save
  him meets with an accident that robs him of his memory. The climax and
  the fall grow out of the confusion of identity that follows, and a
  ne’er-do-well’s one impulse of manhood.

  fascinates and compels admiration for the old officer and his
  comrades. Like Sir Evelyn Wood, Sir John French, and Sir Henry
  Hildyard, Colonel Robertson was a middy before he took to soldiering,
  and a love for the sea and life afloat bore fruit in many stirring
  episodes in his subsequent career, while to the credit of the seaman’s

  “The convert” is not merely a novel, it is a strong plea for woman’s
  suffrage. The work of the suffragettes of London with their open air
  meetings in squares and on wharfs crowded with rude and unsympathetic
  mobs is glaringly described until the heroine, if not the reader, is
  drawn over to them and their cause. The heroine, now a splendid woman
  moving in society’s inner circle, was, when a young girl, deceived by
  the man she loved and led to sacrifice the child which was to have
  been hers. Now, with this burning loss in her heart and the cause of
  down trodden woman strong in her soul, she meets the man once more
  and, closing the past forever, gives him to the girl he now loves but
  asks in return his help in the cause, that by helping other women he
  may expiate his guilt toward one.

  “By ‘the human element’ is meant, in distinction from divine
  revelations, ‘things that can be proved by ordinary historical
  testimony’—including, as Dr. Salmon assumes, the miraculous element in
  the gospels. His work is essentially devoted to an investigation of
  the sources of the gospel story, conducted with a purposed
  independence of traditional opinions.... ‘Editorial blunders’ are
  found in Matthew, and Luke is found to have ‘taken liberties with the
  earlier tradition’ of the resurrection. The Greek text only of the
  gospels, substantially that of Wescott and Hort, is given in parallel
  columns, beginning with the entrance of Jesus on his public
  career.”—Outlook.

  “Intelligent direction for systematic and discriminating study” is the
  aim of this book. It meets the needs of four classes of student: (1)
  the college student, (2) the graduate student in oriental history, (3)
  the student of theology, and (4) the general student of the Bible. The
  book covers both the Old and New Testaments, and is divided into four
  parts: (1) Hebrew literature and history, reaching from the beginning
  to the fall of Jerusalem (586 B. C.); (2) early Jewish history and
  literature (586–168 B. C.); (3) later Jewish history and literature
  (168 B. C.–135 A. D.); (4) early Christian history and literature.

  standard laid down by the authors, it is that of answering the
  requirements of the graduate student. Otherwise, by a wise use of the
  literature assigned and a classification of the material thus procured
  there is little doubt that the book will prove very useful and helpful
  in filling the blanks in many students minds which should be occupied

  “This volume is the most comprehensive and far-reaching exposition of
  the new humanism that has appeared, yet the possibilities it suggests
  are more fascinating than the theories it definitely develops.” (Ind.)
  “What is humanism? And what its Transatlantic cousin, pragmatism? Have
  we in either of them a logic or a metaphysic, or both, or neither? Dr.
  Schiller does not shirk these questions.” (Ath.) His best constructive
  work is the essay on “The making of truth” in which he “disclaims the
  notion that truth is created by us out of nothing.”

  mind was constantly assailed by a selfish husband exploiting all the
  proprieties of life decides to live apart from him. She goes abroad
  and makes a cozy drawingroom the center of a warmth which she radiates
  after the fashion of her own serenity, sincerity and dignity. The
  daughter, devoted to the father, furnishes the second type. At his
  death the mother returns to find her daughter an arrogant, selfish,
  heartless girl unable to detect values. The third type is honest Jack
  Pennington whose integrity but reveals more convincingly the girl’s
  shallowness and the mother’s patient unselfishness.

  The letters of Mademoiselle de Lespinasse not only form a human
  document that reveals a tortured existence but are a symbol of the
  revolution accomplished in contemporary thought during her period,
  viz., “the change of the age of reason into the age of passion and
  sentimental license.” The author had access to archives heretofore
  unattainable which cleared up facts regarding the early life of
  Mademoiselle Lespinasse, her education, relations with the Marquis de
  Mora, and the public and worldly side of her character. The sketch
  embodies its negative lesson chiefly in this intense woman’s blind
  adoration for Count de Guibert. Her suffering strikes the universal
  note, and she pays the full retributive price for her wrong-doing.

  Based upon a study of the Homeric poems, this book deals with the life
  and times as reflected in the poet’s language. Hence it is
  philological rather than archaeological. The importance of the
  undertaking to the modern reader lies in the fact that Homer’s picture
  of the life of his age is the earliest account extant of the culture
  from which our own is a true lineal descendant. The cosmography and
  geography of the country are studied, the family, education, dress,
  food, slavery, trade, sea life and ships, agriculture, animals,
  worship, arms and war.

  scholars. His rearrangement of the plays according to chronology
  within the three well-recognized divisions of comedies, histories, and
  tragedies, by which ‘Tempest’ appears as the seventeenth instead of
  the first play, is likely to give qualms to readers rather than to
  scholars. Both innovations seem to me to be worth trying, and it is
  needless to approve the small amount of textual apparatus in such an

  strong argument for some sort of ‘motor theory’ of consciousness....

  extensive and minute experiments as well as to the results found by
  other investigators. Numerous reproductions of myograph curves, etc.,

  ‘The seven studious sisters’ represents the same spirit in an amusing

  While Walter and Anne Majendie are upon their honeymoon rumors reach
  the wife of scandal attached to her husband’s name. Anne at once
  enters the cloister of her own spiritual high mindedness thereby
  securing for herself a “sort of spiritual divorce from him, while she
  martyrised her body which was wedded to him.” Miss Sinclair delineates
  intimately the cold virtue of the wife as by degrees it drives away
  the half boyish, genuinely honest and wholly devoted husband who seeks
  consolation in a little shop girl. Only after terrible suffering does
  Anne realize that Walter has kept all his marriage vows except one,
  and she had broken all of hers, except one. Her understanding comes as
  a surprise, and permits the curtain to be rung down upon a happier
  group than seems possible from the stand point of logic.

  The story of how the thirteen colonies in asserting their own
  independence tried to force it upon Lower Canada. “It will appeal
  primarily to the specialist in American history, for few general
  readers of history would care to digest some twelve hundred pages to
  gain even a thorough understanding of a failure.” (N. Y. Times.)

  which Mr. Smith has unearthed and worked into his mosaic. Yet we are

  differently. Here his eye is somewhat too close to the object for
  broad vision. And thus his defects in point of view make his attempt

  A discussion based upon two series of letters. “The letters from labor
  leaders, in answering the question put to them, ‘What do workingmen
  want?’ state the commoner demands of labor for shorter hours,
  increased wages, and improved conditions, and embrace such concrete
  suggestions as postal savings tanks, government ownership and control,
  state board of arbitration, restriction of immigration, the closed
  shop, and protection of women and children. Employers demand loyalty,
  freedom in management of affairs, the open shop, a ‘fair’ day’s work
  for ‘fair’ wages, and respect for law and contract agreements. The
  author’s comment upon these demands is entirely sympathetic. In a

  as to place him among the distinguished men of his generation, and
  certainly was not such as to warrant his biographer’s assertion that
  had he lived longer he would have been prime minister of England. His

  speaks in favor of it,” on the other, that the bodily cells of man are
  not strangers to alcohol and to its elaboration, that it nourishes,
  exerts a specific action on the nervous system, acts no less as a
  nutrient and a specific than cereals and sugar, and that the
  disposition to drink excessively has its origin in the peculiarities

  In the vernacular of the rover, Sam Daly recounts his “rolling-stone,
  happy-go-lucky” experiences mainly on “Mississippi river steamboats
  and the rafts and landings alongside from Cairo to New Orleans.” Sam’s
  partners are his dog Rags and Clancy, the expert “tosser” of hot
  rivets into a bridge-builder’s bucket. They run the round of chance,
  sometimes are masters of fate, often a prey to it, but are ever
  cheerful philosophers.

  A story written for the purpose of revealing the horror of the rubber
  traffic on the Congo, to show what has been the effect of the white

  nobler fight than ever mediaeval crusaders undertook. The uncle dies

  government that enriches itself on their blood; go to the
  fountain-head and expose the hypocrisy of King Leopold.” Jack carries
  on his battle with Samba at his side, Samba, whose woeful plight had

  Two spinster sisters, “upon whose frail maiden shoulders had devolved
  responsibilities hitherto unknown to the women of the name of
  Simpkins” lose the fortune of their Arkansas forebears and have to
  face the question of earning a livelihood. They hit upon the idea of a
  Woman’s exchange, establish it and manage it with credit to the name
  of Simpkins. Their rather tame existence is broken by bits of town
  gossip, echoes of sentiment of long ago, and chiefly by a proposition
  of ten thousand dollars for the collection of birds in the extending
  of which an only brother had lost his life.

  cover the middle fifty years of the last century. This was a period of
  anarchy, brought to an end, though not at once, by the appointment of

  “The title poem of the volume, a brief Morality play, called ‘The fool
  of the world,’ employs a style which admirably suits the theme,
  infusing into the simple colloquy between Man and Death all the dread,
  the fear, the mystery of mortality as they pervade ‘Everyman’ and
  other of the old Morality plays. Following this ... Mr. Symons has a
  group of ‘Meditations,’ poised and passionless as a Buddhistic
  reverie, fatalistic, ‘sicklied o’er with the pale cast of thought.’...
  Contrary to the mood of his prose, the prevailing note of Mr. Symons’
  poetry is negative and over his pages futility, and ever futility, is

  A strong young man loving life and freedom serves an ascetic uncle for
  seven years. The uncle dies bequeathing his vast wealth to a sect
  known as the Mystics. A sense of deep wrong leads the nephew to
  violate the uncle’s dying request to guard the sacred book of the sect
  until it could be turned over to one of the leaders. He copies it word
  for word, finds that the Mystics look forward to the appearing of a
  prophet, decides to play the rôle himself and to appear at the proper
  moment, his one aim being to secure the money out of which these
  people had defrauded him. His course leads to a dramatic though

  steamer is a triumph of pyrotechnical narrative, assisted by a map....

  Four groups of advisory letters written to four American women
  “occupying quite different places in the historical development of
  love.” Mrs. Van Vorst “thinks that the thing which counts about a
  woman more than anything else, from beginning to end, is her age.” She
  spends half her life “not being old enough and the rest in being too
  old.” And she tempers her advice accordingly. For example, “if a woman
  is over thirty-eight she must have patience in dealing with the man
  she loves; if she is less than twenty-five she may risk defiance in
  order to bring him to terms.” (Ind.)

  “Mr. Vaughan gives a generous interpretation to the Naples Riviera,
  including the Islands of the Blessed that float in a pellucid

  long buried in a shroud of ashes, to Salerno of the once famous
  medical schools, to Pæstum with the temples that were dilapidated when
  S. Paul landed at Puteoli, and to Amalfi which was for a time supreme

  The unique situations growing out of a wealthy young widow’s purchase
  of a husband constitute the fabric of this tale. Mrs. Merlin seeks out
  a good looking, broad-shouldered young Englishman, offers him the sum
  of twenty thousand pounds to marry her and protect her during a year
  of travel; at the end of which time either may end the contract.
  Shadows out of the past flit across the path of each which are
  dissipated by the growing faith in each other. The year’s end brings
  to them an earldom and proves that their trial marriage has been
  successful enough to endure.

  A frank analysis and discussion of the factors that go to make what is
  known as the “Far Eastern problem.” The study resolves itself into
  three parts: Japan and the new position. China and the Chinese, and
  The powers and their influence. The author warns his reader against
  over confidence in the ten years’ truce now in operation, yet he does
  believe that it will be one of the greatest constructive victories of
  diplomacy, if, during nine years of the Anglo-Japanese alliance, a
  permanent Far Eastern peace is evolved. There are nearly two hundred

  The interest of the first part of this story centers in the efforts of
  young John Amherst, who occupies a subordinate position in the
  management of the Westmore mills, to solve some of the industrial
  problems there presented, particularly in providing for the health and
  safety of the employes. His opportunity to carry out his cherished
  plans seems to be at hand when he gains the sympathy and interest and
  finally the love of the beautiful young widow who owns the mills. The
  marriage follows, and a little later there befalls a terrible accident
  in which the wife is hopelessly injured and to put her out of her
  pain, Justine, friend and nurse, administers an overdose of morphine.
  Justine marries Amherst who thru the blackmailing scheme of a young
  physician learns of Justine’s act and for a time is overwhelmed with
  her technical responsibility of Bessie’s death while his reason tells
  him that she is innocent.

  rather unsafe business of aiding one of them in divorce proceedings in

  observation from a New York to a Paris drawing room, Mrs. Wharton has
  made the enamel of convention only a little more brilliant, and in
  suffering it to crack to reveal a shrivelled up heart, only shows that
  underneath such gloss, life has ceased to ring true to any standards
  of spontaneity. Family, society, and the church are inexorable Molochs
  to whom must be sacrificed infant joy, freedom, hope and even courage.

  inspection, public convenience and safety, extra work etc. Foundations
  are then taken up, concrete, old paving stone and broken stone being

  block asphalt and rock asphalt. The various ingredients of these
  pavements are treated in detail, and the best methods for laying each
  pavement are specified. Granite, brick and woodblock pavements are
  given ample attention, and in the closing pages paragraphs of a

  A novel in which a young man tells his own strange story. While
  enjoying a spring-time stroll in Central Park he is suddenly
  confronted by an up-to-date carriage containing two pretty women, one
  of whom declares she is his wife. Despite his remonstrance he is
  thrust into the carriage by the foot-man, embraced, welcomed and
  carried off to a luxurious house where he is told that he is Julian
  Randolph, a young millionaire whose sudden disappearance was a matter
  of national comment two years before. So far the story differs little
  from other novels of mistaken identity, but the concluding chapters,
  which establish the right of the hero to the love and the position he

  of seventy-five, with uncounted millions, and ten United States

  “For the [embodiment of a method and system for solving religious]
  problems its data are too scant and its touch too light. Moreover, the
  employment of logical, ethical and metaphysical categories is so
  frequent and so apparently a priori as almost to belie the author’s
  initial appeal to the standards of inductive inquiry. There is present
  also a lack of clearness and incisiveness in the concepts which are
  described as involved in religious experience. The reader feels
  himself sometimes on shifting sand when he looks to deal with a

  Sedate Oxford is made the setting for this astonishing tale of a dual
  personality, of the young Don who marries Milly, the quiet and
  adoring, and who loves Mildred the reckless, deceitful and
  captivating. These two natures struggle for mastery in the body of his
  young wife until after a series of strange happenings, Milly
  heroically sacrifices all in order that the rival within her, the
  invader whom she has come to hate and fear, may not embitter her
  husband’s future or ruin the life of the child, really Milly’s child,
  who has already felt the strange alternating maternal influences that

  great symphonies like Beethoven’s Pastoral and Tschaikowsky’s

  Wagner’s great drama of love and death; and ‘The spirit of the piano’

  the wilderness haunts of wolves and bears. “His pictures of nature as
  he saw it in that frozen world are remarkable, while the makeshifts to

 2. P. 459, “insight, humor, comprehension, sympa-” was the incomplete

 3. Please note that the publisher split hyphenated surnames. The
      portion after the hyphen was listed before the forename. The
      portion before the split was listed after the forenames with a
      hyphen. E.g. E. Burton-Brown was listed as =Brown, E. Burton-.=
 4. Added Table of Contents.
 5. Removed the bold markup from book titles with no author listed. This
      is to be consistent with book titles with authors listed. Also the
      publisher was inconsistent in the book title markup—usually only
      the first word but sometimes the entire title.
 6. Included “and” in the authors bold markup to be consistent with
      majority practice in this book.
 7. Added missing “A” heading on p. 1.
 8. Silently corrected typographical errors.
 9. Archaic, non-standard, and uncertain spellings retained as printed.
10. Did not use a hanging indent in book description in text version.

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
