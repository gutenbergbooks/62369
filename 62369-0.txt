                                PREFACE


    This volume is the third annual cumulation of the Book Review
Digest. It includes principally the books of 1907 that have been
reviewed by the best book critics in England and America. It aims first
to record with unprejudiced exactness the scope, character and subject
content of books as they appear, and further, to supplement this
descriptive information from month to month with excerpts culled from
the best current reviews appearing in forty-seven English and American
magazines which give prominence to book criticism, thus furnishing to
the librarian a basis for the valuation of books. Frequently the best
reviews of a book appear during the year following its publication, so
in this volume will be found supplementary excerpts relating to books
which were entered in the 1906 annual. It will be observed that a number
of entries include only the descriptive note. Reviews for these books
have not yet appeared; 1908 will furnish the material for appraisal, and
excerpts will be included in current numbers of the digest as fast as
reviews are published.

    In sending out this annual the publishers wish to emphasize the
coöperative phase of the undertaking. From three to six people have been
engaged during 1907 in the work of preparing descriptive notes to
approximately 2,800 books, and clipping from 1,000 copies of magazines
sentences most helpful for book selection. This card-index information
furnished to libraries for five dollars per year would cost them many
hundred times this sum should they do it themselves. For the time thus
given to a valuable and indispensable part of library work the
publishers look for an equivalent in the support of libraries all over
the country. The justice of the statement “Time is Money” is
commensurate with its economic terseness.

    Abbreviations of Publishers’ Names will be found in the Publishers’
      Directory at the end of The Cumulative Book Index.

    An Asterisk (*) before the price indicates those books sold at a
      limited discount and commonly known as net books. Books subject to
      the rules of the American Publishers’ Association are marked by a
      double asterisk (**) when the bookseller is required to maintain
      the list price; by a dagger (†) when the maximum discount is fixed
      at 20 and 10 per cent, as is allowable in the case of fiction.

    The plus and minus signs preceding the names of the magazines
      indicate the degree of favor or disfavor of the entire review.

    In the reference to a magazine, the first number refers to the
      volume, the next to the page and the letters to the date.

    Books noticed for the first time this month have an asterisk (*)
      immediately below the author’s name in entry heading.

    A Maltese Cross (✠) indicates that the A. L. A. Booklist suggests
      the books for first purchase. The letter S indicates that the same
      publication recommends the book for small libraries.

                  *       *       *       *       *

        The publications, named above, undoubtedly represent the leading
reviews of the English-speaking world. Few libraries are able to
subscribe for all and the smaller libraries are supplied with
comparatively few of the periodicals from which the digests are to be
culled. For this reason the digest will be of greater value to the small
libraries, since it places at their disposal, in most convenient form, a
vast amount of valuable information about books, which would not
otherwise be available.

        We shall endeavor to make the descriptive notes so
comprehensive, and the digests so full and accurate, that librarians who
do not have access to the reviews themselves, will be able to arrive at
substantially correct appreciations of the value of the books reviewed.

        This is particularly true in regard to the English periodicals,
which are practically out of the reach of the ordinary library, we shall
endeavor to make the digest of these reviews so complete that there will
be little occasion to refer to the original publications.

             Devoted to the Valuation of Current Literature

    Digests of Reviews appearing in January-December 1907 magazines




                                   A


=Aanrud, Hans.= Lisbeth Longfrock; trans. from the Norwegian by Laura E.
Poulsson. *65c. Ginn.

                                                                7–21362.

  Norwegian farm life is pictured with quaint detail in this story of
  Lisbeth, the little peasant who came to Hoel farm as its herd girl and
  by faithful service won the proud position of head milk maid.

                  *       *       *       *       *

  “Gives the best picture we have of Norwegian farm life.”

       + =A. L. A. Bkl.= 3: 205. N. ’07. ✠

  “A very neat translation of a very pretty little Norwegian story.”

       + =N. Y. Times.= 12: 493. Ag. 10, ’07. 180w.

  “A simple and delightful story.”

       + =Outlook.= 86: 833. Ag. 17, ’07. 60w.


=Abailard, Pierre.= Abelard and Heloise: the love letters: a poetical
rendering, by Ella C. Bennett. **$1.50. Elder.

                                                                7–30637.

  True only to the sentiment “upon which thread this rosary of love
  letters has been strung” the author has rendered the letters of
  Abelard and Heloise in rhyme.

                  *       *       *       *       *

  “A sympathetic setting forth in English verse, of the letters of these
  historic lovers.”

       + =N. Y. Times.= 12: 667. O. 19, ’07. 10w.


=Abbot, Francis Ellingwood.= Syllogistic philosophy or prolegomena to
science. 2v. **$5. Little.

                                                                6–29755.

  A posthumous work that represents a life time of study. “The
  determining principle of the whole structure is that ‘whatever is
  evolved as consequent must be involved as antecedent.’ The outcome of
  this ‘principle of absolute logic’ is that personality, in the
  philosophic sense of the word, is ‘both the source and outcome of all
  that is,’ and that philosophy at last becomes ‘theology modernized as
  scientific realism and scientific theism.’” (Outlook.)

                  *       *       *       *       *

  “We confess that we have found in his work little to clarify the
  problems of philosophy and nothing besides the author’s own
  earnestness and enthusiasm which we can call uplifting. In no way does
  the book appear to us to be a prolegomena to science or an important
  contribution to philosophy.”

       − =Nation.= 84: 180. F. 21, ’07. 530w.

  “The novel terminology once mastered, the new method becomes
  interesting.”

     + − =Outlook.= 84: 683. N. 17, ’06. 390w.

  “They are erudite and earnest, but dogmatic and ineffective. We do not
  question the earnestness and sincerity which have produced these two
  volumes, but we do question whether the absolute unit-universal will
  save his philosophical children from their sins through the message of
  the syllogistic philosophy.” R. B. C. Johnson.

     − + =Philos. R.= 16: 447. Jl. ’07. 1300w. (Review of v. 1 and 2.)

  “Well equipped with wide and careful reading as Dr. Abbot evidently
  was, he seems to have fallen upon an arid formalism which forces him
  to serve up afresh, and with reiterated emphasis, many of the
  contingent features peculiar to idealistic absolutism in the
  nineteenth century.”

     + − =Science=, n.s. 25: 854. My. 31, ’07 1550w.


=Abbott, David Phelps.= Behind the scenes with the mediums. *$1.50. Open
ct.

                                                                7–27622.

  From the point of view of the worker of magic, Mr. Abbott, who is not
  a medium, reveals all the tricks of the séance. “The ardent believers
  whose faith no number of exposures can disturb, the skeptics whom no
  sort of séance has been able to convince, and the scientific
  investigators toward whom the author is a bit contemptuous, will all
  find in its pages matter in plenty either interesting or irritating.”
  (N. Y. Times.)

                  *       *       *       *       *

  “All those who have a kind of shamefaced desire to know just what
  spiritualists do and how they do it will be entertained by his
  exposures. Even those who go full of faith to consult palmists,
  clairvoyants, fortune-tellers, and other modern sorcerers, will find
  him interesting.”

       + =Nation.= 85: 212. S. 5, ’07. 840w.

  “There will be racy reading for a good many different kinds of people
  in Mr. Abbott’s leisurely turning inside out of mediumistic tricks.”

       + =N. Y. Times.= 12: 551. S. 14, ’07. 1110w.

         =R. of Rs.= 36: 511. O. ’07. 40w.


=Abbott, Rev. Edwin A.= Apologia: an explanation and defense. *$1.
Macmillan.

                                                                7–25561.

  “In reply to friendly dissentients from his views, especially as
  expressed in his previous book, ‘Silanus the Christian,’ the author
  publishes this ‘explanation and defense’ of them as an introduction to
  two volumes of a technical and critical character to appear presently.
  His view of the Biblical miracles is ‘that some are literally true,
  but in accordance with what are called laws of nature; others are not
  literally true, but are metaphorical or poetical traditions
  erroneously taken as literal; others are visions that have been
  erroneously taken as non-visionary facts.’”—Outlook.

                  *       *       *       *       *

  “It may be pointed out that Dr. Abbott’s reason for calling Christ
  supernatural has nothing to do with the evidence furnished in the New
  Testament and it is therefore not easy to see why there should be such
  a waste of interpretation as there is in his books.”

     + − =Ath.= 1907, 2: 363. S. 28. 640w.

         =Outlook.= 87: 312. O. 12, ’07. 130w.


=Abbott, Rev. Edwin A.= Silanus the Christian. *$2.60. Macmillan.

                                                                7–25561.

  Dr. Abbott addresses himself to readers who are not ready to accept
  the miraculous element in the New Testament and who at the same time
  do not reject the doctrine of Christ’s divinity. He shows that the
  belief is not rendered impossible by the disbelief. The book is in the
  form of an autobiography of an educated Roman. “The gist of its
  teaching—and it is solely intended to teach—is summed up in the words
  of Clemens. It has been said, he tells Silanus, that the religion of
  the Christians is a person—and nothing more. ‘I should prefer to say
  the same thing differently. Our religion in a person—and nothing
  less.’” (Spec.)

                  *       *       *       *       *

  “Dr. Abbott’s writing is itself interesting on account of the literary
  skill with which he presents innumerable points of exposition and
  criticism, and on account, too, of the beauty and strength of many of
  its passages.”

     + − =Ath.= 1906, 2: 766. D. 15. 1040w.

  “While the book aims to be popular, the author’s wide knowledge and
  competent scholarship lift his efforts entirely above the level of the
  usual endeavor to teach Biblical and Christian history by means of
  fiction.”

       + =Ind.= 63: 575. S. 5, ’07. 210w.

  “The book is interesting; it is ably written; it is in parts striking;
  and yet one feels that somehow it misses effect as a whole. And we
  think that the reason is obvious. Dr. Abbott in writing it had two
  diverse ends in view and each interfered with the other.”

     − + =Lond. Times.= 6: 25. Ja. 25, ’07. 740w.

       + =Nation.= 84: 180. F. 21, ’07. 560w.

         =Outlook.= 84: 633. N. 10, ’06. 180w.

  “It would be unfair to lay stress upon the weaknesses of a really
  impressive book, and after all they are only prominent in one part of
  its argument where the writer has been carried away by his own pet
  theories.”

     + − =Sat. R.= 103: 24. Ja. 5, ’07. 530w.

  “As to whether he has succeeded or failed in his religious purpose his
  readers will no doubt form diametrically opposite conclusions. We
  think, however that those who are most convinced of his theologic
  failure will not deny him a literary success. He has written a deeply
  interesting theological book in the form of a story.”

     + − =Spec.= 97: 569. O. 20, ’06. 2110w.


* =Abbott, Katharine M.= Old paths and legends of the New England
border: Connecticut, Deerfield, and Berkshire. **$3.50. Putnam.

  In Miss Abbott’s rambles one may live over again the delights of many
  of New England’s quaint byways. “She has caught the spirit of New
  England, and introduces incidentally curious and charming
  out-of-the-way places, historic spots, Indian legends and New England
  folklore.” (Ind.)

                  *       *       *       *       *

  “She has traced it all with a literary skill which is above the
  average, and has succeeded in charging her text with animation and
  entertainment without the loss or historical accuracy.”

       + =N. Y. Times.= 12: 763. N. 30, ’07. 150w.


=Abbott, Lyman.= Christ’s secret of happiness. **75c. Crowell.

                                                                7–10562.

  Eleven essays are included here whose keynote is sounded in the first,
  “Three kinds of happiness.” “There are three kinds of happiness,” says
  Dr. Abbott, “pleasure, joy, blessedness. Pleasure is the happiness of
  the animal nature; joy, of the social nature; blessedness, of the
  spiritual nature. Pleasure we share with the animals, joy with one
  another, blessedness with God.”

                  *       *       *       *       *

       + =Ind.= 62: 1474. Je. 20, ’07. 60w.


=Abbott, Lyman, ed.= Parables. $2.50. Appleton.

                                                                7–31966.

  A very illuminating introduction shows that Jesus resorted to the
  parable to allay the wrath which his plain truth-teaching had stirred
  up against him. “He veiled the truth which unveiled had been rejected
  with such wrath, and he did so that they might listen to him without
  perceiving the truth to which they would refuse to listen if they did
  perceive it.” The scriptural version of the parables follows, with a
  well-executed illustration here and there suggesting the modern
  prodigal, the modern foolish virgin and the present-day house builded
  upon the sand, etc.


=Abendschein, Albert.= Secret of the old masters. **$1. Appleton.

                                                                6–40200.

  How did the old masters produce their results? How have these results
  defied time and atmospheric changes? Twenty-five years of study have
  been devoted to these questions by the author and “he has proved to
  his own, and we may say, to our satisfaction, that the great Venetians
  and Flemings used no mysterious varnishes whatever, their vehicle
  being plain linseed oil, and their reliance for permanence and
  brilliancy being plenty of time for drying between successive
  paintings and upon prolonged exposure to direct sunlight to burn out
  the excess of oil.” (Nation.)

                  *       *       *       *       *

  “Few serious workers in oils, though they omit the book, will fail in
  the next year or so of coming upon the track of his researches.”

=Abhedananda, Swami.= India and her people. $1.25. Vedanta.

                                                                6–24887.

  A book which aims to “give an impartial account of the facts from the
  stand point of an unbiased historian, and to remove all
  misunderstandings which prevail among the Americans concerning India
  and her people.” It sets forth for popular reading phases of Vedanta
  philosophy. “In this system the people of India, according to the
  author, find the ultimate truths of all sciences, philosophies, and
  religions. There are instructive chapters upon the religion of
  present-day India, the social status and the system of caste,
  political institutions, education, the influence of Western
  civilization, and woman’s place in Hindu religion.” (Lit. D.)

                  *       *       *       *       *

  “This compact little volume, written in an attractive style, and
  dealing with the life, philosophy and religion of India should prove a
  useful addition to the literature of a fascinating and as yet largely
  unknown subject.”

       + =Lit. D.= 34: 263. F. 16, ’07. 140w.

  “From the historical point of view, which is assumed by the Swami, it
  is to be regretted that the author has not made himself better
  acquainted with chronology.”

  “In the present volume we find Acton’s inaugural lecture as Professor,
  his scheme for ‘The Cambridge modern history,’ and nineteen of his
  lectures, covering in giant strides the ages of the Renaissance, the
  Reformation, the Counter-Reformation. the wars of religion, the rise
  of political parties, the creation of the Prussian and the Russian
  powers, and the American revolution.”—Ath.

  Including A college fetich, 1883; Shall Cromwell have a statue? 1902;
  Some modern college tendencies, 1906. In these addresses Mr. Adams
  arraigns many of the weaknesses of the present-day college régime. The
  license of electives leads to the “way of least resistance:” college
  athletics are but the “overgrowth of the superficiality which rules
  the curricula,” etc. He offers helpful reform suggestions on the
  limitation of the number of subjects pursued, on the moral training of
  the student, and on the breaking down of our large colleges into

  obtained from this handbook for boys. “It tells how to make cells and
  batteries, switches and insulators, armatures, motors and coils. It

  For the dogmatic, even sentimental peace-notions bruited about the

  peace embodying the later humanism, whose meaning is implied in such

  moral values” and “forming new centers of spiritual energy.” She
  offers the moral substitutes for war that are an outgrowth of a
  definite national background.

  The slim Princess Kalora of Morovenia is the despair of her father and
  fat younger sister because there is a Turkish law which reads that the
  elder must marry first and there is a Turkish preference for fat
  wives. Kolora is not only slim but spirited and she merrily takes her
  destiny into her own hands and, assisted by a kindly Fate, succeeds in
  marrying a venturesome young Pittsburgh millionaire. The story is
  breezy, clever and full of cheerful irony.

  The aim of the author is to show that heresy trials such as the one to
  which Mr. Crapsey was recently subjected are contrary to the
  principles of the English reformation and the whole spirit of the
  Anglican church. He considers historically the ordination vows and the
  various articles of the creed, and shows that their original
  significance has been lost sight of in the interpretation given them
  by heresyhunting churchmen of to-day, and that the doctrine of the
  virgin birth in particular has been emphasized out of all proportion

  The author’s all-inclusive philosophy is developed along the following
  line: “Starting with the established facts of science, seeking the
  causes of manifested phenomena, tracing the causal series to the very
  limits of scientific investigation, inevitably finding at the limits
  of the physical process an effect for which the physical cause can be
  discovered, and driven to attribute such effect to some agency outside
  the world of sense, I reach at length the inevitable conclusion that
  there is a world of which this physical process came, upon which it
  rests, by which it is energetically sustained; in a word, that the
  present world is but the phenomenal representation of the forms of
  cosmic energy.”

  A rising English politician suddenly finds himself put out of the race
  in the House of commons by coming into a peerage with its accompanying
  seat among the lords. A young American girl, a distant cousin, with
  ambitions and temperament akin to his own urges him to start life all
  over in her own California. “Once safe in California, the story
  proceeds breathlessly. Notwithstanding all the descriptions, all the
  lenses which have been turned on that exotic city, [San Francisco] she
  still is able to give a picture of untarnished freshness. The story
  reaches its climax in the dramatic scenes of the San Francisco
  earthquake.” (Nation.)

  inevitable in a narrative devoid of the above mentioned qualities by
  constant recourse to the phraseology of others or to awkward

  Four essays, The water-star, Landscape of the soul, The haunts of the
  hind, and Do we see nature? In the first one the water lily is used
  for a lesson. The author shows that in sending forth above the surface
  of the water so wonderful a flower the roots do quiet work in the
  murky depths; so in life, if crowning success be attained, there lies
  back of it the commonplace pegging away at stale duties.

  Italy furnishes the stage, and her people the actors for this study in
  psychology. A very unhappy Italian woman moved by the sinister
  fascination of an ancestor’s homicidal act of killing her lover by
  poison resorts to the same means to rid herself of a husband whom she
  loathes. “Ugo, the hapless count, his wife Cristina, the Duchess of
  San Felice, and Fabrizio, the guilty cousin, are all human figures.”

  quite foreign to that of the Anglo-Saxon; and yet, at the same time,
  he interprets them so skilfully that the sum total of your impressions
  is rather that of the brotherhood of the two races than of the gulf
  between them.” Frederic Taber Cooper.

  “A folio of over two hundred pages, whose plates exhibit the best
  features of nearly fifty American country-places, scattered from Maine
  to California and from Massachusetts to North Carolina. The owners’
  and architects’ names are generally given, and a plan of the estate
  often supplements the pictures of its most attractive aspects. All of
  the houses are of the more pretentious kind of country-seat, such as
  ‘Blair Eyrie’ at Bar Harbor and ‘Biltmore’ at Asheville; but they are
  artistic rather than showy, and prospective builders may get many
  hints from the book, even though they may be working on a much smaller

  “Professor Baldwin’s book deserves high commendation even though one
  cannot agree in all details with the particular theory of mental
  development which he sets forth. The book gathers together a wealth of
  data regarding mental development, and is so well grounded upon
  biological facts and principles that one who is not a specialist in
  genetic psychology hesitates to criticise it. Nevertheless, the
  particular theory of mental development which Professor Baldwin
  champions—the imitation theory—seems to the writer decidedly weak at
  certain points.” Charles A. Ellwood.

=Baldwin, James Mark.= Social and ethical interpretations in mental
development: a study on social psychology. *$2.60. Macmillan.

  “The whole argument of Professor Baldwin’s book is that society is a

  evolution upon the development of the self-thought. Accordingly, he
  finds the matter of social organization to be thoughts; and he denies
  that animal associations constitute true societies, since animals do
  not possess self-consciousness.”—Am. J. Soc.

  “It is a political pamphlet, in which the author makes use of material
  professedly furnished by the history of the Dutch republic for the
  purpose of a long invective against the evils of democratic and party
  government, and especially against the particular form of government
  which exists in Great Britain. Mr. Ellis Barker also writes
  undisguisedly as an advocate holding a brief on behalf of the
  necessity of Great Britain’s adoption of a strong imperialist and
  federal policy based on the maintenance of a powerful navy and
  army.”—Lond. Times.

  “In style he certainly does not approach Motley, nor does he impress

  Stella Hope is early left an orphan and lives, like Cinderella, in the
  home of an austere aunt and her three daughters. To this house comes a

  The book deals with the problems of physics which the ice-packs of the
  St. Lawrence give rise to. The ice-formations known as
  sheet-or-surface-ice, frazil-ice, and anchor-ice are discussed in
  relation to their mode of formation, general appearance, position they

  and as a pioneer work of the author’s effort deserves the more
  consideration. That the arrangement of the matter and the progression
  of the argument are sometimes lacking in directness, and that at a few
  points the language is a bit awkward, is therefore of minor import. To
  our view a serious fault of the book is its total silence on the
  subject of trouble with ice at water-works intakes.”

  “In this book Mr. Beard tries to solve a problem very real to teachers
  of large history classes—the twofold problem of introducing each
  member of the class to a number of great authorities on special
  periods and topics at the same time, and of securing a critical
  examination of the materials in the class-room. His work differs from
  the well-known source-books in that it consists of excerpts from the
  secondary sources only: e. g., Maitland, Freeman, and Stubbs.
  Thirty-six authors are represented and a larger number of works. The
  difficulty of making a wise selection from abundant materials is
  recognized and fairly met. Each chapter is prefaced by a brief,
  explanatory statement concerning the citation, which is divided into
  sections with topical headings. These form a brief, clear analysis....

  up in detail, in the order in which they are met by the practical

  One feels that Mr. Bennett fairly slaps his canvas with a Kipling

  give English readers as intelligible a narrative as that enjoyed by
  readers of the original, we have to point out that the work has been
  carelessly done, and that the English reader often finds himself
  mystified where the Russian finds himself enlightened. When in his old

  to the restoration of the Bourbons by the allied sovereigns of
  Europe.... The pages are filled with lively reminiscences and amusing
  anecdotes in which figure all the famous folk of this wonderful time,

  Anecdotes of the English court and aristocratic society abound, and
  much criticism of English manners and customs, pointed by comparisons

  The financial and commercial amalgamation of the nations is the

  A biography full of side-lights on the history of Italy during the

  buffet his way among despots and courtiers identified with Italy’s
  decline and corruption.

  always has had and always must have a religion as a guide to conduct,
  and the lesson we learn from the past is that a new religion grows
  gradually out of an older one as man’s knowledge increases. According

  Steeped in the atmosphere of the athletic field, this story of a
  foot-ball season, written with all the life-likeness and authority
  which inside knowledge can afford, makes its appeal to every champion
  of a college eleven. All the stages of team development are
  interestingly set down and gridiron encounters, including the great
  end-of-the-season victory are realistically described.

  “Mr. Browning’s new book is a personal history of Napoleon between the
  years 1813 and 1815, and the author does not claim therein to bring to
  light new facts, but to summarize the results of other people’s
  researches. His book, is, however, more valuable than might be
  expected, because he gives for the first time in English a view of
  Napoleon’s character and conduct, largely founded upon the work of M.
  Albert Sorel, rather different from that generally accepted in this
  country.”—Acad.

  The second volume of a series which aims to do for French literature
  what has been achieved for the English and American men of letters.
  The sketch deals not so much with the biographical facts of Balzac’s
  life, as with the elemental points that define, explain and

  relation between that continent and Great Britain. “The bond is not
  one that has grown strong by reason of political adjustments or of
  commercial necessities. Its virtue consists in the fact that it has
  not been manufactured in the mills of diplomacy. The more it is
  tampered with, the weaker it becomes. It is made of impalpable
  materials—of such materials as memory, sentiment, self-abnegation,
  heredity, pride. To attempt to trim it in one place and to buttress it
  in another is to attempt to alter its character and thus bring about
  its decay.”

  The author reads nature like an open book and imparts the messages
  learned with the bloom of truth and poetry still fresh upon them.
  Flowers and birds and tiny animals are his friends, and as he wanders
  among their haunts he betrays the intimate enthusiasm of the true
  nature-lover. The book suggests leisure, the “hurry never” manner of

  A cyclopædic work which on the one hand includes the history of Sudan
  from its earliest mention in Egyptian history down to the close of
  independent Egyptian rule; and on the other, contains an account of
  the temples and other antiquities written after four archaeological
  expeditions, during which the author studied these monuments in their

  “Few scholars can compete with Dr. Budge in the learning and

  Lying back of these essays is “a mass of information and of personal

  Mr. Burbank’s investigation into plant life—“creating new forms,
  modifying old ones, adapting others to new conditions, and blending
  still others”—has impressed him with the points of similarity between
  the development of plant and human life. He shows that the human plant
  needs the environment of love, sunshine, air, and nourishing food; he
  discusses heredity, predestination, training, growth and character. It
  is a sane and earnest treatise on life and its possibilities.

  If it were not for the prologue the reader might be mystified over
  certain psychic revelations which the hero as palmist and clairvoyant
  makes to the heroine concerning her past life and her future. As it
  is, the trick of the clear seeing is bared, and one is prepared to

  A tale which suggests “Double trouble.” The possessor of the dual
  personality is a young girl, charming and womanly one day, and
  hoidenish and cruel the next. She is under the spell of a hypnotist
  who makes use of his power over her to the end of extorting money from
  her. A prince in the form of a broad-shouldered young architect is
  thrust upon the mercies of the “white cat” as the result of a motor

  destroying the fatal work of the fairies and annihilating the lower

  cheap metals into gold. It comes into the possession of a young
  Englishman who is seized with a mania for gold, which, he learns to
  his later sorrow, is the curse of the god, Kiao Lung upon the
  possessor of the metal globe. His thrilling experiences make a full

  There is much that is food for thought in this tale of the socially
  elect of the England and America of today. Reuben Vanderpoel of New
  York has added greatly to the millions his father wrested from the new
  world, and his two daughters carry that wealth to the old world to
  re-build two fine old English estates. The elder daughter, Rosie, is
  the victim of a dissipated fortune-hunter who abuses her and neglects
  his property. It is left for her sister, Bettina, the best product of

  mother’s cousin “Thinkright” Johnson, so called because of his faith
  in a happy solution of all life’s problems if only one’s thoughts are
  right and harmonious. Under the influence of Thinkright’s fine example
  of brotherhood love, Silvia scripturally finds herself, thru losing

  closed shutters is symbolic of Silvia’s discordant outlook on life,
  but with her transformation even the shutters open and let the

  The “daddy,” “a rank amateur in the baby business” confesses the

  thing that the nurse brings for his proud expressions of joy. He
  further records the agony of the first “spank” administered after the

  This ode limns the impression of a graduate revisiting his Alma mater

  statement one naturally expects in engineering books; and the
  qualifications necessary to make statements of fact accurate and

  A monologue urging the training for the human body that corresponds to
  the progress of the soul in its regeneration. The little volume
  belongs to the “What is worth while series.”


=Calthrop, Dion Clayton.= Dance of love. †$1.50. Holt.

  A romance of the days of the “dawn of intellect” with scenes shifting
  from France to England. It is a tale of a love quest upon which Pipin,
  the hero, meets a dozen women. Each one affords the author an
  opportunity to draw an individual type of the dame of yesterday. The
  dominant qualities of the “eternal feminine” are strikingly portrayed.

                  *       *       *       *       *

  “Mr. Calthrop has sacrificed too much to high morality. It will
  certainly be much liked by those who value originality of idea and
  vivid, poetical expression, and we think that the insatiable readers
  of novels, who rather resent these merits, will forgive them in a
  short book full of attractive incidents related in an unusual form
  with considerable dramatic effect.”

  A history of English costume in four volumes which divide the subject
  into as many periods: 1, Early English; 2, Middle ages; 3, Tudor and
  Stuart; 4, Georgian. “The colored illustrations will appeal to
  everybody, but the little sketches in the letterpress will be
  invaluable to the costumier and the stage manager if not to many
  tailors and milliners as well. Scattered throughout the four volumes
  are also a series of word-pictures, of which mention must be made.”

  to which, nevertheless, the author acknowledges his supreme
  obligation. If we now mention a few points in which our author is

=Calvert, Albert Frederick.= Alhambra of Granada. *$15. Lane.

  The history which forms the background of this volume covers the
  Moslem rule from the reign of Mohammed to the expulsion of the Moors.
  “The Alhambra or the Red castle, will ever, in spite of its lamentable
  state of decay, take first rank, on account of the combined beauty and
  variety of its ornamentation, and the thrilling memories with which it
  is associated.... The author lays great stress in the preface to his
  first edition on the fact that he has given pride of place to the
  pictorial side of his volume, making his chief appeal to the public by
  the beauty and variety of the illustrations he has collected, which
  include nearly 500 reproductions in black-and-white of details of
  architecture, and over 100 in colour of typical decoration.” (Int.
  Studio.)

                  *       *       *       *       *

  In picture and text this proves the first exhaustive English treatment
  of the Escorial—the Spanish royal palace, monastery and mausoleum in
  one.

                  *       *       *       *       *

  “The views of the garden of the Casita de Abajo and of the interior of

  photographs of pictures and tapestries are much less effective; while
  the reproductions of Alfonso’s ‘Cantigas de Sancta Maria’ and other
  literary rarities are on so reduced a scale as to be virtually

  One of Mr. Calvert’s series on Spain. Seville, “great because of her

  historically with emphasis placed upon the preservation by the

  Madrid’s famous “congress of masterpieces”—the Prado. “The text does
  no more than tell in a general way something about the painters
  represented, name the more famous masterpieces, indicate the division
  into schools, and show how these schools, Spanish, Italian, and Dutch,

  This book is based mainly upon an examination of decisions of the
  Supreme court of the United States, arranged in such order that
  together they make a critical commentary upon a constitutional power.

  A volume which “is intended to give American students, an accurate if
  somewhat succinct account of the course of Post-Napoleonic European
  political history,” and “does not pretend to be more than a

  “The author was apparently in too great haste to attend much to the

  mixed up indiscriminately, and extraordinary language is indulged in.
  Most of it is fairly good, and the characterizations of public men are

  Jealousy incites Howard Van Courtland to murder his business partner.
  Malcolm, a young clerk in their employ, is accused and the story is
  mainly concerned with the trial in which Van Courtland’s daughter,
  learning of her father’s guilt, is bent upon clearing Malcolm. She
  draws information from the prosecuting attorney and passes it on to
  the defendant’s counsel, all of which finally proves of no avail until
  in a dramatic court-room scene the father confesses his guilt and dies
  suddenly. In the end misunderstandings are adjusted and love wins a
  hard fought battle.

  The story of the pearl is told “from its birth and growth under tropic
  seas, through the search for it by dark skinned divers of the Orient
  and its journeyings by the hands of men who traffic in precious
  things, until it becomes finally the cherished familiar of the great.
  Historical and traditional allusions, the sentiment and superstitions,
  the romance of ancient and noble associations drawn to it through the
  ages, are garnered here and to them added the more prosaic facts which
  a merchant’s experience suggests, to enable lovers of the dainty
  sea-gem to discriminate.”

  children from six to nine in the Sunday school. The development of a
  general religious theme is aimed at in each group, and the groups
  follow each other in logical arrangement. The book is suggestive
  thruout and may be used in the home as well as in the Bible school.

  The second work of a series whose plan is to deal with all the
  important literary forms in English by a division according to types
  rather than a division into chronological periods. A concise
  description is given of the earlier appearances of the rogue as a
  typical figure in the literatures of Spain, France, Germany and
  Holland; then follows the rogue of the mediaeval time as he appears in
  drama, legend, and jest book, and the rogue of the picaresque novel of
  Elizabethan time. Criminal biographies, prison chronicles, drama,
  opera, sociological studies, and lyric verse are shown to yield their
  rascals, and the authors who have portrayed them are discussed.

  This is a story of Dublin from the year 150 A.D., in which the author
  does his surest work when he reaches mediaeval Dublin with its wealth
  of reliable material. He writes of the city, its topography, its
  buildings, of the variety and picturesqueness of the outlying country,

  A group of Russian peasants among Alaskan snows enact here a drama
  impossible in its primitive passions to a more conventional setting.
  The wife of Luka dies in the first chapter, and he, crazed by her
  loss, wanders away to search for her. He fancies he has found her in
  his brother’s promised bride, wins her love, is wounded in the quarrel
  with his brother for her possession, and awakes after an illness to a
  realization that she is not the much loved wife he has lost. How these
  two souls so oddly met, so strangely bound together, work out their
  own happiness is the story of the book.

=Clark, Henry Martyn.= Robert Clark of the Panjab. **$1.75. Revell.

  “This volume commemorates the life and work of a pioneer missionary
  amidst a fierce and fanatical people, in northwestern India.... The
  courage and gentleness, the energy and patience, the self-devotion and
  tactfulness of the ideal missionary were all illustrated in him, and
  he did not lack ‘the saving grace’ of a sense of humor. The narrative
  is blended with sketches of the land and the people, their ways, and
  the lights and shadows thence resulting. Especially noticeable are the
  indications of an active interest of both officers and privates of the
  British army in Christian missions, outrunning a timid policy of the
  civil government.”—Outlook.

  Mr. Clark “approaches the problem of religion and the object of
  religious belief from the ethical standpoint. He proposes to treat
  religion, not as a science of God and his relation to man, but as an
  art, the ‘art of character-production.’ His book is itself evidence
  that the Christian religion is primarily a mode of life and conduct,
  rather than a system of science or philosophy.”—Am. J. Theol.

  “Mr. Clark writes eloquently and persuasively. His argument would be
  stronger and more complete if he had pointed out in his chapter on
  ‘Christian self-culture’ how identification with Christ involves for
  man the realization of a definite ideal of service and self-sacrifice.

  “It is a simple story of life-long devotion to the missionary cause,
  ending with a hopeful, if somewhat meagre, outlook.” (Nation.)
  Thirty-three years of residence in her corner of the world have
  brought Mrs. Clark “into contact with many interesting stories of the

  Aims to describe the “history of the political labour party of
  Australasia, to analyse its policy and the results of that policy so
  far as applied, and at the same time to make clear the difference as

  Our much loved humorist has done another kindly service to his dumb
  brothers in this story of the cavalry horse, Soldier Boy, and the
  sunny little girl who loved him and all the world. There is much
  amusing satire in the story, but beneath it there throbs a great

  for true recognition of this service in the tragic death of little
  Cathy who lays down her life for the horse who has once saved it.

  The unpleasant story of Queen Caroline, the much disliked wife of
  George IV. is given in detail in this volume. “To speak of her in the
  words of the romantic and attractive title of this book as ‘a queen of
  indiscretions’ is to put her case very leniently indeed. Knowing that
  scandalmongers were constantly busy with her name, she deliberately
  did whatever a mind remarkably fertile in expedients could devise to
  make herself talked about the more. Finally she left England and spent
  six years trailing her little court ... all over Europe and even into
  Asia. Much of this time she spent in Italy. And it is to the records
  of her stay in that country that Signor Clerici has especially devoted
  himself in the preparation of this book.... The illustrations are
  numerous and interesting.” (N. Y. Times.)

  “A convenient and sensible handbook, setting forth the doctrines of
  sound health of mind.... The nature of brain action, its dependence

  This work continues the series of reproductions of paintings by old
  masters including Old Italian masters, Old Dutch and Flemish masters,
  and Old English masters. The enduring value of Mr. Cole’s engravings
  has been faithfully imparted to these reproductions while the text
  furnishes an interesting story of Spanish art. “Starting at the moment
  when Italian art was entering upon the superb achievements of the high
  renaissance, it survived the latter’s decay, reached its own
  independent climax in the seventeenth century, and received a
  supplementary chapter at the end of the eighteenth. As a connected

  David Baldwin, a young minister, just out of the divinity school,
  receives a call to a conservative pulpit in a Minnesota town, one

  “A compact yet broadly suggestive historical introduction to English
  literature for use by students and by general readers.” The subject is
  taken up in six successive periods: Paganism and Christianity
  449–1066, which treats of Anglo-Saxon poetry; Religion and romance,

  treatment of the drama before Shakespeare, especially the mystery and
  morality plays, is inadequate and not compactly grouped. We are of the
  opinion, too, that many readers of the book will be inclined to
  disagree with Professor Crawshaw in his assigning Pope a place as a

  the Duke of Guise, Philip of Spain, etc. “The story proper begins with
  the day of the barricades, where Francis Agnew, an agent entrusted
  with high matters by the kings of Scotland and Navarre, is also left
  dead. His daughter is aided in her extremity by a certain professor of
  the Sorbonne and a gallant young student, John d’Albret, who became

  A three-part work on economics illuminated by the thought “that the
  symbol of a revolving wheel is the natural symbol of the reproduction
  of wealth, and that the laws of the increase and decrease of wealth,
  as well as the immediate deduction therefrom, must be identical with,
  and so be transferable from the mathematics of a mechanical wheel of
  wealth and the science of political economy.” Part 1, treats of
  “Reconstruction;” Part 2, “Free trade and protection;” Part 3, surveys
  the “Critical and historical” aspects of the subjects, passing under
  review the English and foreign schools.

  A guide-book, yet it withholds information about the details of

  and also of each city, from which the traveler may form an idea of the
  states of civilization under which the various art treasures of each
  locality were produced and of the people who made them. Then follow
  descriptions and studies of monuments, churches, museums, and their
  contents. The books are not intended to take the place of an ordinary
  guide book nor to furnish catalogues of collections. The aim of the

  A work which has less of the text-book aim than that of creating for

  A most handsomely made book, “undertaken primarily for the Indians, in
  the hope that this, their own volume, when placed in the hands of
  their children, might help to revive for the younger generation that
  sense of the dignity and worth of their race which is the Indian’s

  Includes “The suburban whirl” and several shorter sketches which
  contain tangible precipitates from every-day happenings in home
  routine. The titular story shows how in attempting to solve the
  question of providing for three on a slender income two charming young
  people try suburban life. “They find themselves speedily caught in the
  small local maelstrom of clubs and dinners and subscription dances,
  obliged to buy tickets to church festivals and charitable

  Mrs. Cutting ... is that her instinct for economy of structure is
  almost flawless. A larger number [of characters] would have spoiled
  the illusion of a small suburban town; a smaller number would not have
  conveyed a sense of a social whirl in the suburbs of anywhere else. In

  The subject of Miss Davenport’s study has been the court rolls of the

  Mr. Davidson tells in these six lectures what the poem has come to
  mean to him, and has sought to lay bare its “philosophical or ethical
  skeleton.” Speaking of the poem, he says: “Its content, I believe, is
  the entire spiritual movement toward individual emancipation, composed

  Davidson’s ideas are interesting, and some of his remarks on single

  stoicism is mainly derived, on its ethical side, from the impulse of
  Socrates and the sophists. The second section, on ‘Stoic science and
  speculation,’ contains chapters dealing with the conception of
  philosophy, the logic and epistemology, the physics and cosmology, of
  the school, concluding with a chapter on the atomic theory of Epicurus
  in its relation to stoicism. The third section has for its title
  ‘Morality and religion,’ and occupies about half the book. It
  contains, in addition to a detailed exposition of the ethical system
  and its relation to cynicism, some useful pages of criticism, in which
  the defects of the system are indicated; and an interesting chapter
  entitled ‘Present-day value of stoicism,’ in which the dicta of
  eminent moderns, such as M. Arnold and Renan, concerning the stoic
  moralists are examined and appreciated.”—Ath.

  This piece of historical fiction deals with the invasion of Greece by
  the Persians under Xerxes. Altho many of the characters are fictitious
  and the love story is purely imaginary, the scenes are apparently true
  to the times, and Athens and Sparta are made to tremble before the
  invader as history tells us they trembled, while her heroes of the
  hour play the glorious parts which history says they played. Perhaps

  A novel with a purpose which presumes to command a 1940 view point.
  “His standpoint is frankly imperial, and even partisan. He assumes
  that the trend of the present government is towards weakness and
  sentimentalism and the neglect of national interests; and from that
  postulate he has developed a pretty pickle for the country it governs.
  The Germans land in force on the coasts of East Anglia, and in an
  almost incredibly short time Great Britain is at their mercy.
  Thereafter comes the rebuilding—the re-edification which is implied in
  the title. This tack is initially undertaken by Canadian preachers,

  A slight story of Margaret Deland’s favorite spot, Old Chester. When
  Letty Morris and Alfred Price tried in early youth to elope, the good
  Dr. Lavendar, whom they sought to unite them, withdrew for a moment
  and sent a message to the parents of the runaways. Their day of bliss
  was over. The encore is the repetition of the love-making after fifty
  years, and this time it is dissenting children who make the way hard;
  but Dr. Lavendar comes to the rescue and this time lends his clerical
  aid.

  “Catherine is a girl of quiet charm and of lifelong devotion to an
  ideal of romance. She quite takes hold of the readers heart, and he is
  glad that she loves to the end the stately, handsome, conscientious
  husband she has awesomely admired as a girl, and that she never
  penetrates the secret that he is essentially a dull and commonplace
  gentleman. In contrast to Catherine there are two capitally drawn
  elderly women, one of infernal temper and overbearing self-approval,

  clever in character-reading and in social comment.”—Outlook.

  The lonely lady is a pretty country bred girl of twenty-five who comes
  to Grosvenor square as the guest of a great-aunt and stays there after
  her aunt’s death to watch over the estate which is an inheritance of
  her twin brother who is in active service in Africa. The account of
  how she tries to do honor to her name and position by following the
  social code of her country rector’s wife, and how from the dull
  loneliness of London state and formality she is rescued by her distant
  cousin the Duke, forms a pretty old fashioned love story.

  In this volume Mr. Deming “gathers up some loose threads of
  autobiography and romance.... The six chapters or sections are chiefly
  reprints from ... periodicals. Opening with an account of his rise to
  the dignity and emoluments of a court stenographer, Mr. Deming goes on

  Alice-for-short, six years old and timid, bravely plods thru a London
  fog with a jug of beer. She breaks the jug, which accident brings to
  her side a protector, who, a little later, when the drunk-sodden
  parents die, rescues her from the basement of an old house in Soho and
  places her in the care of his sister. The chief interest of the tale
  lies in the development of the child in intimate portrayal, the simple
  life-likeness of characters, and the sure tho delayed consummation of
  the romance. There are ghosts and mysteries in the plot which seems to
  be a sensitive conscience’s concession to the veteran novel-reader
  rather than a scheme vitally necessary to the character-drawing.

  The adventures of a messenger boy whose inflated rubber suit sends him
  bouncing through the air with astonishing ease and rapidity. He visits
  the land of bogie men, bugbears and ghosts, and exposes them to
  youthful readers as entirely harmless.

  Dr. Densmore’s theories are based upon the teachings of Darwin,
  Spencer, and modern exponents of the doctrine of evolution. The book
  teaches that women are more intuitive, refined, unselfish and
  spiritual than men, but are inferior to them in initiative, resource,
  power and breadth of view; that these mental differences are not
  fundamental nor the result of sex but are caused by environment and
  heredity. The book makes a strong plea for extending democracy into
  all phases of human life.

  “Beverley Teruel, nicknamed Girlie because of his lack of
  sophistication, shortly after leaving Oxford marries the girl of his
  father’s choice.” (N. Y. Times.) “Beverley flies into a morbid
  suspicion of the purity of his perfectly healthy passion. He seeks
  solace in a platonic affection for a literary woman, finds it
  difficult to exist without her, disobeys her by rushing to London to
  see her, and, when severely snubbed, falls an easy victim to the wiles
  of a woman of the town. During his absence Eva has been making
  discoveries which impel her towards a whole-hearted bid for her
  husband’s vanished affection. But it is too late. Innocence has given

  very ordinary, common-place prig, quite incapable of understanding the
  real nature of the girl who has given herself to him. He is perfectly
  ready, indeed anxious, to do ‘the right thing’ and marry her as soon
  as possible, but he is at no pains to disguise his personal feeling
  that Joan is really a ‘fallen’ woman. She resents his attitude ...
  comes gradually to the realisation that it has all been a terrible
  mistake. She comes to see that she has no love for him at all, and
  that marriage, so far from setting everything right, will only be an
  added wrong.”—Acad.

  The Vedanta philosophy which grew out of the teachings of the
  Upanishads represents the common belief of nearly all thoughtful
  Hindus. Following a brief introduction which gives the fundamental
  idea of the system, Mr. Deussen discusses the Vedanta’s teaching
  regarding theology, cosmology, psychology, migration of the soul and

  “All criticism of the work must return to the question of the success
  of the dramatic dialogue as an essay form. On the whole, one finds
  himself inclined to decide that the experiment is successful; for the
  dialogue has enabled our author to realize his hope of effectively
  setting forth the clash of the individual with a movement. And yet
  there is a little reserve about one’s commendation of the book as a
  whole. In the first place, it can appeal only to a much narrower
  circle than most of Mr. Dickinson’s other productions. In the second

  this story. A department store proprietor becomes a magnate thru the

  men after its dissolution to use its garb and methods for personal

  coquettish curls and a Dolly Varden, who is a daughter of the thief.
  It makes this willful young woman suspect the young man of the

  The man and his history are sketched as fully as is possible in the

  Dr. Du Bois’ aim has been “to establish an explanation of the purely
  quantitative Latin poetry which shall reconcile the opposing views as
  to an apparent clash between word accent and verse accent.” Her work
  “consists of ninety-six pages only, but every paragraph is closely

  “Justice is here presented as the root-principle of the moral
  life—_the_, rather than, as the Greek and Roman philosophy esteemed
  it, _a_ cardinal virtue.... Wisdom and justice, as Plato taught, are
  mutually involved and inseparable. This is finely exemplified in Mr.
  Du Bois’s treatment of ‘the culture of justice.’ His ‘basal rule of
  practice is to _think justice_—to do this as an acquired _habit of
  mind_.’... Mr. Du Bois draws largely upon facts both of adult and
  childish experience to illustrate by discriminating criticism what
  justice is and is not, both in large matters and in small, down to
  keeping dirty shoes off of car-seats.”—Outlook.

  pastimes, related with the charm of a poet, the skill of a dramatist

  Mr. Dunn “was one of a party that strove to reach the summit of Mount
  McKinley, crowned with everlasting snow and ice in the sub-arctic
  solitudes of Alaska. Day by day he kept a diary of the movements and
  adventures of the party, noting the smallest details. After the
  unsuccessful attempt had ended, and those concerned in it had returned
  to civilization, the idea of publishing the diary occurred to its
  author, and he determined to lay before the public an unvarnished
  tale.”—Dial.

  Set in England this story with its tangled threads and continuous
  action shows how an inheritance proved a pitfall. A naive,
  unconscionable girl marries the gouty old Sir Peter—of a less
  irascible temperament, tho in many points not unlike Sheridan’s Sir
  Peter—and does it to save herself from the battle for bread. After the
  sudden death of Sir Peter a daughter is born, and the mother, finding
  that the bulk of the estate had been willed to a nephew, begins a long
  series of sham proceedings which, to hold the property for herself,
  require that the child be brought up as a boy. At sixteen the child
  takes things into her own hands, apparently drowns, reappears as a
  twin sister who, so the fiction ran, had for family reasons been sent
  to California in infancy, restores to the cousin his property, falls
  in love with this cousin, and, heart-broken because it is not returned
  and because she has all thru life served only as her mother’s tool,
  drowns herself. Plot and counter-plot abound.

                  *       *       *       *       *

  Russia of today as an American sees it. Mr. Durland spent a
  twelve-month traveling thru European Russia, Poland, the Caucasus, and
  a part of western Siberia. Mr. Durland’s presentations are not only
  picturesque descriptions of a traveler, nor yet merely thrilling

=East, Alfred.= Art of landscape painting in oil color. *$3. Lippincott.

  “Mr. East has not attempted in this book to write of landscape
  painting in its elementary stages. His aim has been rather to give the
  already qualified student an insight into certain truths which have
  been revealed to him in his own practice of the art. To correct a
  false attitude towards nature, and to help the reader to understand
  the importance of technique, has been the aim of this book. It is
  illustrated by eight landscapes and a page of studies of effects in
  colour, and many halftone pictures, chiefly from the painter’s works;
  also an admirable selection from those pencil sketches in which he
  excels.”—Int. Studio.

  The chivalry of the Indian warrior and the womanliness of the Indian
  woman are subjects which Mr. Eastman sets forth with authority and
  sentiment. In an idealized sense his tales become more “than mere

  The small town element is here in the fact that every one knows the

  a divorce suit, or the adventurous young minx with the peroxide hair

  The symbolism which abounds in this book reminds one of Ibsen. A
  little boy seeks diligently from fairy guides a solution to the riddle
  of the universe and its manifold manifestations. As he grows older his
  desire for understanding is no less keen but for the fairy thoughts of
  imagination are substituted the troll-ideas of grotesque human
  realities. Finally among the sordid commonplaces he falls in with a
  companion who is a “modern reincarnation of the Christ.” There is a
  very human love tale, the romance of the imaginative Johannes and
  Marjon, a little circus girl.

  A plantation romance whose scene is laid in Virginia following the
  reconstruction period. “Warren Rhett, the hero, is a young Virginian,
  enlightened, enfranchised, energized by education in the north and a
  cosmopolitan experience as a bridge builder, not solely as the lover
  of the good and beautiful heroine.” (N. Y. Times.) The heroine is the
  daughter of a sculptor; the love-making is uninterrupted in Warren’s
  step-mother’s home where he is recuperating and incidentally rescuing
  the plantation from decay and bankruptcy.

  “This book belongs in that class of which Anthony Hope’s ‘Prisoner of
  Zenda’ is the prototype. A brave and resourceful American is thrown
  into the dynastic plots of a petty imaginary nation in eastern Europe,
  and plots and counterplots develop in rapid and thrilling succession.

  A sequel to “River and jungle,” in which the hero of the latter sets
  out with a native guide to capture a white elephant. Before the quest

  The last in the three-volume “Paddle your own canoe” series. There is
  in this story plenty to whet the appetite of an adventure-loving
  lad—mystery, a brave sailor boy as hero, a shipwreck, the discovery of
  pirates’ gold, treachery, a search extending to India, wild beasts of

  A reprint of a dime-novel published nearly 50 years ago, which

  novel literature not only was not immoral but was good reading for the

  About the slim figure of a young widowed duchess of an old estate in

  matrimony. His villainy succeeds, but she finds true love and
  happiness and he receives the coveted revenues only to find them poor

  The characters in this story, adapted from the play, are a degenerate
  head of the house of Kerhill, the mother whose whole aim in life is to
  preserve intact the honor and dignity of her house, Jim Wynnegate,
  cousin to the Earl of Kerhill, and Diana, the latter’s wife. The
  scenes shift from London to the plains of western America, whither Jim
  goes to serve out a term of self-imposed exile, having assumed his
  cousin’s guilt of theft to save the Kerhill honor. The dramatic
  element predominates in love scenes, wild-west quarrels, and in the
  tragedy of devotion.

  “the one thing true of all life in motion, and the prime instinct of a

  Two volumes which contain “a history of the age of Caesar, from the

  history is drama, with its characters, its passions, its plot and its
  setting—above all with its exquisite irony, the analytical
  foreknowledge of a Greek tragedy-chorus of which he is the leader.
  Roman history is no longer a weary catalogue of wars and laws, of
  risings and assassinations, sprinkled with names which by their very
  schoolday familiarity have become meaningless. Still less is it the
  blind hero-worship of a single personality to whom is ascribed a

  Becky Warder, in whom has been born and bred the habit of petty

  The action of this novel, filled with a strange mixture of spiritual
  discernment, theories of reincarnation, and the idea of the vendetta,
  takes place at a castle hermitage owned by the count Caesar d’Ormengo.
  There falls to the count the care of a beautiful niece Mariana, morbid
  in fancies and self-analysis. She learns from a secret compartment in
  her escritoire that she is the reincarnation of an ancestor who went
  mad in those very walls because of inhuman treatment, and who commands
  that the one whose eyes shall fall upon the memorandum of her agony
  find the way for revenge. Involved in the scheme of vendetta are the
  count, Corrodo Silla, a young secretary whose life is linked to
  Mariana’s as the reincarnated lover, a German secretary and his
  daughter. The story waxes horrible as Mariana executes her mission of
  vengeance: she causes the death of the count, kills Silla and drowns
  herself. But through all is inexorable fate, to which, not conscious
  of her own power to baffle it, she yields.

  David Rivers is wrested from his young love-making by old Robert
  Henley, a self-constituted guardian, and is sent away to develop a
  promising literary talent. The success and failure of an impersonally
  detached ambition become the keynote of the story. Rosemary Crewe whom
  David left behind is the embodiment of the strong love motif of the
  tale while Violet Winter, the fascinating New York woman whom he
  marries, is the stumbling block. Violet contemplates full reparation
  to David in allowing a threatening disease to go unoperated upon. How

  Talks for the young man contemplating a business career, for one who
  is unafraid to think, to work, to sacrifice, who looks upon business
  not as a pastime, nor as an unpleasant necessity, but as a human duty.
  The advice has grown out of the experiences of a man who has followed
  a strenuous business life. He claims no new business philosophy, but
  puts principles which time has tested into new form better suited to
  present day needs.

  inclined to shape the world and life in accordance with human
  conditions and human needs, than to invest spiritual activity with an

  A brief story which is an exaltation of sensuous fascination into an
  affair of the soul and which casts the moral law to the four winds of
  heaven. A titled young Englishman is sent away from home to be cured
  of his love for a rural English girl with red hands. In Paris he meets
  and falls in love with the queen of a Russian dependency, “infinitely
  sinuous and attractive” who is residing at his hotel incognito. They
  yield entirely to the sway of their love which the author’s art aims
  to transform into the poetry of sentiment. They suffer the agony of it
  in separation followed by tragedy.

  An interesting biography written by one who knew Mr. Godkin personally
  and who writes appreciatively of the many phases of the man who left

  The “Darnman” is a pathetic figure whose mental disorder resulted from
  the death of his affianced bride upon their wedding day. Clad in his
  wedding garments, for two generations he went the rounds of the
  farmers’ homes, accepted one-meal hospitality, and invariably asked
  for needle and yarn to mend his threadbare clothes. This little story
  has grown out of the traditional bits gathered from different sources.

  Two young Jews, after struggling for two years against poverty and
  opposition in the Odessa University, come under the ban of expulsion.
  One is reinstated because he finds favor with the prefect, who lures
  him into an assistant secretaryship, demanding that origin and
  religion be forgotten. The other goes back to his little town and with
  his people takes up the cudgel against the government. The story
  follows the mental agony of the traitor Jew and the retribution which

  The “struggle between two temperaments” forms the subject-matter of
  this volume relating to Edmund Gosse and his father. The offspring of
  parents married late in life, the boy grows up in an atmosphere
  heavily charged with extreme English Puritanism. “When the child’s
  ‘temperament’ began to develop, it displayed itself as a passionate
  attachment to the romantic in art and poetry; and there were infinite
  possibilities of discord between a father who, though he enjoyed
  declaiming the sonorous lines of Virgil and Milton, prided himself on
  never having read a page of Shakespeare, and a son who saved up his
  pocket money to buy the poems of Coleridge and Keats, and, on one

  The author has chosen the rough and wicked England of the twelfth
  century as the setting for his story of Hyla, the serf, whom he has
  made typical of serfdom, and within whose misshapen body burned the
  first spark of freedom which was to enkindle the world. The coarse
  times are well depicted from the lewd life of the barons in their
  castles to the hopeless routine of the serfs in their shacks. The
  personality of Hyla who rises from the herd about him and becomes a
  man and a murderer to avenge his daughters and his wrongs, is strongly
  brought out and the reader follows breathless until he has paid the
  awful price exacted from such as he.

  “Prof. Gummere starts out with a severely critical consideration of
  just what must be meant by ‘popular’ as applied to ballads and rules
  out all but about 300 specimens of the genre. While he treats the
  ballad as a closed account, an outcome of conditions which no longer

  of ballads which in time may become as popular as any in this

  As Aunt Jane cuts squares for patchwork out of “caliker that won’t

  them into her wild-goose pattern quilt she grows reminiscent and with
  pristine verve and histrionism recounts delicious tales of long ago:
  how Sally Ann delivered her message of denunciation to the men of
  Goshen church for demanding that their wives be the submittin’ kind,
  and how the women of the Mite society bought a new organ for the
  church in spite of the husbands who thought it a frivolous proceeding.
  Unruly human nature, bits of scandal and gossip are all softened by
  time, and as Aunt Jane recalls them she touches them up with her
  quaint philosophy and delightful sentiment.

  The author “thinks that we have not only proof of the existence of a
  supernatural world, but also knowledge of its inhabitants and
  governing laws. He bases his views almost entirely upon the accounts
  given in the Bible of angelic visitations, miraculous events, etc. It
  is astonishing what an elaborate structure he rears on their
  foundations. The supernatural world he conceives on the analogy of the
  natural.... The angelic beings ... have bodies like the human, only
  more ethereal; senses like the human, only more refined; and are
  nourished, not by food taken in the mouth, but by elements absorbed
  from the atmosphere. Fancies like these are multiplied, and curious
  speculations abound.”—Am. J. Theol.

  “This is the story of a woman who, having made in extreme youth an
  uncongenial marriage, is tempted beyond withstanding to skip blithely
  away with a young subaltern, Charley Osborne, less from love of him

  The author of “The autobiography of a thief” offers in this volume a
  first hand study of the life of a Chicago labor leader and trade
  unionist. After a long search Mr. Hapgood found a German who, both as
  a type and a person, combined the desired temperament, character and
  experience for his impressionistic study. Born in Germany, Anton came
  to America as a child, shifted much of the time for himself, lived
  thru the various stages of tramp life, rural, sordid conditions,
  worked off and on at odd jobs, finally married and settled down in
  Chicago as a wood-worker. His quick intelligence discovered the
  injustice of organised society on every hand and led him to the basic
  principles of radicalism with which the book deals.

  The life of deprivation and penury which falls to the lot of the man
  renowned for fairy tales was at variance with the results of his fine
  imagination. The sketch follows the cobbler’s son thru the sore trials
  of his early life to his day of fame, which proved a sad realization
  inasmuch as it was bereft of the fulfilment of his one romance.

  “An interesting, trustworthy account, simple and straightforward in
  telling. Will, perhaps, be enjoyed best by the children of an age most
  interested in the fairy tales if read aloud to them, for the style is
  adapted, rather to older children.”

  “There is not much attempt at coherent construction in the little

  connection. And the style reminds us frequently that the author is
  writing in a language other than the one to which he was born.” Grace

  Believing that all commendable conventionalities are more or less
  directly traceable to some altruistic or utilitarian principle, the
  author presents the fundamental features of good form by combining
  ethics with etiquette. She aims particularly to help girls who have
  not had the benefit of proper home training.


=Harcourt, L. W. Vernon.= His grace the steward, and the trial of peers:
a novel inquiry into a special branch of constitutional government. *$5.
Longmans.

  A two part work. “The first describes the evolution of the Lord High
  Steward of England up to the reign of Henry VIII., and the second
  treats of the gradual working out of the principle that peers shall be
  judged only by their peers. In both sections it is Mr. Harcourt’s
  delight to show the fraudulent basis of what have been honored as
  historic English institutions.” (Nation.)

  of constitutional history.”

  “We have here, in short, a notable contribution to our institutional
  history not merely for the results attained, but also for its rigid
  investigation, reminding us how often close inquiry may modify
  accepted views. One rises however from its perusal with the feeling
  that, however impartially the appendices may set the evidences before
  us, the author has throughout a case to prove, is a counsel speaking
  to his brief. And that case is prejudiced rather than assisted by the

  A valuable general text-book. “In addition to a very complete
  discussion of the subject of water supplies in all its aspects,
  including sources, collection and storage, purification, distribution
  and statistics of water consumption, and a rather brief summary of the
  methods of sewage disposal, the writer takes up very fully the whole

  “We think we do the author no injustice in saying that throughout his
  book he writes like a person experienced in general civil engineering
  construction rather than like a sanitary engineer, at least as we in
  America now understand that term. Nevertheless he has epitomized a
  considerable part of water-works and sewage practice, including
  purification in each field, and seems to have produced a book
  remarkably free from errors and vagaries.”

  references to historical and current engineering work, its general
  breadth of view and full citations of original sources of information,
  commend it, in particular, to the student and to the engineer in
  general practice or specializing in other branches. The book lacks

  “In Dr. Harnack’s view, Luke as a historian is inferior to Luke as a

  the belief that between A. D. 30 and 70 the primitive Christian

  conviction,” an account of a “regular and calm development of
  thought.” He expresses a hope that the story of how spiritual rest
  might be achieved may “prove useful to some ‘perturbed spirit’ in our

  A work with which its successor, “Outcome of the civil war,” is
  intended to afford a brief, compact and impartial view of the military
  and civil side of the civil war. Not so much a study of contestants’
  motives as their behavior on the field. Dr. Hosmer says “I have tried
  to criticize men in the light of their opportunities at the time.”

  =v. 21. Hosmer, James Kendall.= Outcome of the civil war.

                                                                 7–7446.

  Although independent in field and in arrangement, this volume is a
  continuation of Dr. Hosmer’s “Appeal to arms,” the foregoing volume of
  this series. It takes up the story from midsummer, 1863 and carries it
  forward to the surrender of Lee, the collapse of the confederacy and
  the assassination of Lincoln.

  =v. 22. Dunning, William Archibald.= Reconstruction, political and
  economic.

  This volume is the first in the last group of the series devoted to
  “National expansion.” The purpose of the study is “to show that
  reconstruction, with all its hardships and inequities, was not
  deliberately planned as punishment and humiliation for those formerly
  in rebellion.” It deals with “the stormy administration of Johnson,
  the year of trouble and unrest in the south, the gradual recovery from
  the strain of war, the great industrial developments, and railroad
  building to the Pacific, the stormy Hayes-Tilden contest.”

  Professor Sparks’ volume begins with the year 1877 that marks the
  break between old issues and the intermediate, vital question of the
  adaptation of American government to the industrial and social needs
  of the country. The first five chapters are devoted to a summary of
  the social and economic conditions of the time; six to eight, to the
  party struggles due to President Hayes’ withdrawal of the federal
  troops from the south; nine to twelve discuss silver coinage and the
  national civil service; thirteen and fourteen discuss the Isthmian
  canal and the exclusion of the Chinese; fifteen and sixteen follow the
  effect on the nation of the rapid settling up of the west; seventeen
  to nineteen deal with conditions which Cleveland found in 1884.

  Beginning with the new economic conditions that the Cleveland
  administration of 1884 found, Professor Dewey traces the course of the
  national problems to 1897. He deals with organized labor, civil
  service, the tariff, silver, railroads, foreign relations, the
  reorganization of the Republican party, foreign policy, commercial
  organization, currency, and the free coinage campaign of 1896.

  “The merit of this volume is the thoughtful and judicial treatment of
  a period of complicated political conditions and of problems new to
  the national life. If any fault is to be found with the book, it is in

  translated by Charles G. Leland. After Leland’s death the work was

  book of songs” and Margaret Armour who translated the last three
  volumes of poetry.

  “We have noted a number of passages in which the German seems to have
  been misapprehended, and many others in which it has not been rendered
  with sufficient fidelity; but otherwise the translation is for the
  most part distinctly meritorious, for Miss Armour is a skilful and
  fluent versifier, and often catches the spirit of her author very

  In this novel the white man plays but a small part. It is a story of
  the Indian of to-day, of the hunters of the Hudson bay country, and it
  tells of their life, their adventures, their superstitions, and their
  customs; closing like the conventional romance with the marriage of a
  young brave and an Indian maiden according to the rites of their
  tribe.

  Rather a traveler’s impressions of the country and its people than a

  A practical little volume for the ungrammatical and for the timid

  To free her lover from an insane asylum, a young heiress searches out
  his double, offers him ample remuneration to assume insanity, become
  an inmate of the asylum, exchange places with the lover and help the
  latter to escape. The one feigning insanity finds the other too
  hopelessly mad to execute the commission; so after a few weeks goes
  forth himself, weds the girl, who supposes him to be her rescued
  lover, and then the complications begin which involve a vendetta meant
  for the man shut away in the “refractory cell” but which in reality
  menaces the life and happiness of the innocent double. The tangle is
  straightened by the death of the real maniac.

  amassing wealth for Maisie. While under his determined hand ruthless
  industry obliterates the landmarks that tradition and sentiment hold
  dear, yet right is right and integrity rules him. Maisie, obedient,
  ambitious, proud-spirited, learns in time that she is kin to the lords
  and ladies of the adjoining estates.

  Bawn is a young Irish girl whose love affairs form the sum total of
  her life affairs. For a time it looks as tho she might be forced into
  an undesirable marriage to keep the family skeleton well closeted, but
  the sacrifice is not exacted. A trusty red setter and faithful Irish
  servants deserve some share of credit in bringing the tale to a happy

  Mr. Hirst contends that competition is still the life of trade and
  that the greater trusts restrict output and increase price. As to the
  origin of the trust “Mr. Hirst seems to think that in England it is
  the child of English law, and that in America it is the child of our

  On the stage which is created by these memoirs, Prince Bismarck is
  well to the fore. “Prince Hohenlohe says very characteristically that
  while Bismarck was in power he dominated all, but after his retirement
  other and smaller personalities swelled like sponges. The light shed
  on the negotiations preceding the Franco-Prussian war are of
  historical value. The account of the plenipotentiaries who met to
  discuss what afterward became the Treaty of Berlin is described with

  of twenty-two papers by leading authorities on various phases of the
  gold supply question, make up an interesting and attractive book. In
  summing up the statements in the various papers of this symposium the
  following points are brought out: First, that for many years the
  output of gold will increase rapidly; second, that, therefore, a
  depreciation in the value of gold will inevitably result.... Like
  several books, which have appeared during the past few years, the

  Instead of marrying a shallow-minded girl with a two-hundred-thousand

  steel interests and he rises to a multi-millionaire’s position of
  prominence and power. The loose morals that result in his abandoning
  and divorcing his wife are astonishingly at variance with his early

  Anthony Brooke, unwilling to battle for bread, hits upon a bold plan.
  During his aimless wandering through Grosvenor square he espies Lord
  Cammarleigh, whom he knows by reputation, in conversation with a
  woman. Brooke observes the restlessness of his eyes and concludes that
  he is a man who has a secret, one who is afraid. With none of the
  malice of blackmail but spurred on by a fortune-hunter’s necessity of
  the things of life, Brooke looked the peer squarely in the eye and
  said, “I know your secret.” A private secretaryship, the management of
  the household affairs and, in truth of the obdurate Cammarleigh
  himself follow for the imposter in a most surprising manner.

  Historical narratives of famous outlaws, the stories of noted border

  The scene of Mr. Hough’s story is once again laid in the west, chiefly
  during the time of the westward movement previous to the civil war. It
  concerns a young Virginian who, tho bound to an eastern girl, finds
  that he loves his companion of many adventures on the great plains.
  Their love-making, interrupted for a time by a villainous emissary
  from the cotton interests in England, and by the war itself, finally
  terminates happily. It has been the wish of the author to show the

=Howard, Newman.= Christian trilogy. 3v. ea. *$1.25. Dutton.

  “Religions may come and go; the forms of morality may change, and what
  is right in one age and clime be wrong in another; but the essential
  virtue remains the same—nothing else than faithfulness to what a man
  holds to be right. That is the idea running through the three plays
  which Mr. Newman Howard calls his ‘Christian trilogy.’... Kiartan was,
  externally, true to his false friend; Savonarola to his false city;
  Minervina and Crispus, Constantine’s discarded wife and son, to their
  false husband, wife, and emperor. In each case there lies behind the
  occasion, the sense of honor, the conviction of the necessity for
  truth to an ideal of right.”—Lond. Times.

                  *       *       *       *       *

  “Mr. Newman Howard’s ‘Christian trilogy’ is real poetry and it is real
  drama. Mr. Howard’s work is so fine that it seems captious to point
  out what we feel to be a defect in it. Though in each of his dramas,
  tragedy is implied in the character of the chief personage, too much
  of the action is controlled by the persistent malignity of another
  individual. Free from most of the tricks of the playwright, Mr. Howard
  still relies too much on his villain.”

  Christianity into Iceland.

                  *       *       *       *       *

  “In ‘Kiartan the Icelander’ his very care for local colour and
  characteristic expression makes his meaning sometimes not easy to
  follow. Possibly in the theatre this difficulty would disappear,
  though we cannot help feeling that he has been so intent on making his

  =v. 2.= Savonarola: a city’s tragedy.

  A drama filled with the “forlorn anti-pagan hope of Savonarola.” Its

  Execution.”

                  *       *       *       *       *

  “Without any sacrifice of dramatic propriety he has so arranged that
  you see not only people but their surroundings. As a result, the play
  is full of the stir and colour of mediaeval Italy. Indeed, though he
  has handled the central theme in a masterly manner, what will delight
  most readers is the extraordinary sense of atmosphere created by the
  minor characters.”

  “In ‘Savonarola,’ Mr. Howard’s more recent drama, the lack of sharp
  definition in the plot and dialogue is much more apparent than in
  ‘Kiartan,’ since all the rival factions and orders, civil and
  religious, of that turbulent period are represented in the play and by
  their machinations so involve the plot that it is difficult to keep
  the various characters and their allegiance distinct.” Jessie B.

  The establishment of Christianity as the state religion of the Roman
  empire furnishes the key-note of the third part of the trilogy. “In
  this play Mr. Howard gets his background, his atmosphere, mainly by a
  single figure; that of the little degenerate Fabius. By an almost
  savage piece of irony, Fabius is made the victim of the plot to murder
  Constantine. The state of paganism at the period of the play is
  admirably indicated by the priests of Demeter with their pitiful
  machinery for working an apparition of the goddess Proserpine. Bombo
  is one of the best clowns out of Shakespeare.” (Acad.)

                  *       *       *       *       *

  “Mr. Howard reaches his highest level of workmanship in ‘Constantine
  the great.’ The chief characters stand out with something of the
  objective reality of sculpture but with all the life and movement of
  human beings. The dialog is reduced to its bare essentials, and
  because no word is allowed for its own sake, every word is not only
  significant but decorative, so that the texture of the verse is as if
  woven of some precious metal.”

  The sixth river to be treated in the series known as “Great waterways
  of America.” “The illustrations which are numerous, are from
  photographs, old prints, maps, and paintings, and are a distinct
  contribution to the value of the book.... The age of the canoe, the
  flatboat, and the steamer, as he names the divisions of the Ohio’s
  history, are each treated fully and entertainingly, in a fashion to
  vivify the heroes of each period, from La Salle, Boone, and the
  Clarks, to St. Clair, ‘Mad Anthony’ Wayne, and the rest of the Indian
  fighters who in their turn were supplanted by the heterogeneous
  multitude of pioneers.” (Dial.)

  intermingling of racial elements, and particularly the jealous contact
  of Yankee and Virginian on the north and south banks of the river. So

  The sixty addresses included in this volume cover the period since
  1900 and deal authoritatively with practical problems as they affect
  actual conditions. The papers are grouped in three sections; General
  banking, Banking reform and currency, and The trust company, and they

  The author says that this volume is a self-prescribed penance for his
  former injustice toward the most beautiful country and the most
  unspoiled and courteous peasantry in Southern Europe. So he makes
  amends for hitherto rating the Portuguese as a Spaniard without any
  good qualities. His greatest interest centers in such places as
  “Bussaco, Thomar and Leiria, of which he gives a vivid series of
  impressions, picturesque, alert, and eminently good-humoured.” (Ath.)

  A journey in central Asia illustrating the geographic relation between

  history. Mr. Huntington gathers up the various hypotheses relating to
  geography, meteorology. archeology, folk-lore and history and combines
  them into a consistent geographic theory of history. The book is the
  outcome of personal adventure from which an analytical mind has
  deduced material which is a worthy contribution to science.

  individual but which limits his ultimate sale of it.

  Two volumes, each containing over two hundred and fifty pages, tell of
  “strange, wonderful and beautiful things ... unknown to cities and to
  the unobservant eye.” Mr. James locates the desert with a good deal of

  observations and experiences all characterized by the vague sense of
  mystery surrounding an untamed, unused and unnourished stretch of

  volumes teach that truth comprises all principles, ideas, and beliefs
  that lead in the long run to the best practical results. Pragmatism is

  A series of twenty volumes entitled “Original narratives of early
  American history,” undertaken under the auspices of the American
  historical society and edited by J. F. Jameson. “The series is to
  consist of such volumes as will illustrate the early history of all
  the chief parts of the country, with an additional volume of general
  index. The plan contemplates, not a body of extracts, but in general
  the publication or the republication of whole works or of distinct
  parts of works.” (N. Y. Times.)

  This first volume of the series is divided into three parts: “The
  voyages of the Northmen,” edited by Professor J. E. Olson, which
  presents the saga in Hauksbok and that in Flatey-jarbok, together with
  some minor Northern and papal pieces; “The voyages of Columbus” and

  public-school workers for its vital contact with the real present, its
  courageous but temperate idealism, and its sane counsels. It is
  characterized rather by a semi-proverbial style than by sustained

  A romance which begins with an eighteenth century smuggling adventure.
  “There are plots and counterplots, political and personal, and
  although the hero, to judge by his own narration, was the most
  innocent idiot that ever acted cat’s paw to a lovely woman, and played
  cup-and-ball with kingdoms without an inkling of it, the reader

  “A story told in the first person is hampered by the restricted point
  of view involved, the impossibility of relating all things as they

  himself. Apart from these drawbacks Mr. Jennings has written a

  “This book is eminently worthy of the excellent series [‘Columbia

  detailed, accurate and complete description, analysis and

  invincible young hero, is suggested in the following: “Tinker adopts
  people. He adopts a sister, a pretty child near his own age, and a
  daughter, a beautiful young woman who is quite grown, and a Russian
  revolutionist to boot. Tinker is a matchmaker, though as a real boy he
  cannot endure to be kissed. Tinker is a detective and a fugitive from

  “Its first part is a study of the meaning of play, its relation to

  “The design of Spanish adventures in the fifteenth century is being
  fulfilled by American engineers in the twentieth.” So says Mr.
  Johnson, and he deals with the incidents and circumstances leading
  from Columbus to Roosevelt. His aim is to give the “salient and
  essential features of the ‘story,’ with as little as possible of

  resources, soil, climate, people, of the technical features of the
  canal and its auxiliary work.”

  not of great importance, and do not detract in great degree from the

  Miss Johnston’s first drama “opens in Brittany on a summer morning in
  1791, and the curtain falls at the end on the banks of the Loire at
  Nantes. The plot is as skillfully devised to awaken and sustain
  interest from the beginning to the end as any of Miss Johnston’s
  stories, and not until the last scene does the reader face the
  solution to the problem. The play has a beautiful setting of terraces
  and ancient homes, and the refinement, dignity, and wit of the old

  intense conviction, of the revolutionary movement.”—Outlook.

  A clear-cut western girl with crudities of heredity, training and
  environment comes into sudden wealth and innocently unashamed, skirts
  upon the edge of conventional society. She is twenty-six and possesses
  the integrity of a man. She falls in love with a youth of twenty who
  is loyal in spite of the determination of his little fashionable set
  to end his infatuation. The story dwells upon the mother’s cruel
  scheme of flicking the girl upon the raw by inviting her to an
  exclusive house party, counting her son’s disillusionment as a result
  of the gulf which she will spare no pains to make apparent. Clem rises
  phoenix-like from the fire of her persecution and shames the
  persecutor’s snobbishness by means of her heroic sense of honor quite
  beyond their comprehension.

  His love-making is interrupted when he embarks for America and becomes
  closely identified with the fortunes of Captain John Smith. “The story
  chronicles the career of the latter, his rescue at the hands of
  Pocahontas, his brave services on behalf of the Jamestown colony, in
  the face of jealous opposition and treachery, the injuries which
  forced him to return to England, and the ghastly winter of bloodshed

  A pretty pastoral this, altho it is set in the present time. Mary, the
  princess in distress, is to inherit a large fortune from a spinster
  aunt if she marries before her twenty-third birthday. The ploughman, a
  recluse and a farmer, offers her his name in order that she may secure
  her fortune and promises to ask nothing in return. Of course they are
  madly in love with each other, else he would not have made the offer,
  nor she accepted it, but each is proud so they marry but to part and

  Desiring to learn details of the fate of two members of his family who

  The author has considered the wiring of buildings by the two and
  three-wire systems only. “The different generating systems, such as
  double-generator, single-generator with a balancer set or with
  compensating transformers are then very simply outlined by the aid of
  diagrams. Methods of wiring buildings approved by the National board
  of fire underwriters, and the proper use of conduit, cables, tubes,

  “In three religions ‘the religion of Japan’ finds various expression.
  Shintoism is religious patriotism; Buddhism is the faith of the
  unlettered and poor; Confucianism is ‘the religion of gentlemen.’
  These three have been variously modified during the comparatively
  brief period of fourteen centuries covered by historical dates. The

  that innate religious feeling in which all religions root.... The

  waif that was left at the stage entrance one stormy night when Calvé

  important reference books and articles is at the beginning of the
  book. This is followed by a sixteen-page general discussion of the
  properties of crystals their arrangement into systems, the symbols
  used, the symmetry, and tractional forms. The systems are then taken

  The women of a northern New England town are seized with the spirit of
  club organization and the “Morning glory club” is the result. General
  improvement, a definite force for good in the town seem to be their
  theoretical watchwords yet they go far afield for bits of gossip to
  retail indiscriminately at their meetings. An equally gossipy group of
  husbands in the background, a village parson who believes that the
  club is the devil’s own disguise, a charming young school teacher,
  misunderstood and much maligned, and the parson’s son, dismissed from
  college for his pranks, furnish some of the personalities with which
  the story deals. Comic as well as tragic happenings abound, but all

  Against the glowing background of Rome’s renaissance, Signor
  Lanciani’s five distinct figures are traced: “Paul III., who during
  the fifteen years that he occupied the chair of St. Peter’s
  accomplished such wonders in rescuing Rome from the degradation into
  which it had fallen; Michelangelo and Raphael, supreme in art;
  Vittoria Colonna, the most cultured of sixteenth century women; and
  Agostino Chigi, the banker whose splendid financial abilities and
  great wealth gave him the surname of ‘Il Magnifico.’” (Dial.)

  telling a story as it were to a single listener. The writer can hardly
  hold himself down for two consecutive minutes to the topic he has in
  hand. Another fault is the tendency to inaccuracy, which appears so

  This is not “as its title might indicate, an anthropological treatise,

  scientific subjects, especially as related to the needs and interests
  of humanity. The first is the Romanes lecture at Oxford in 1905, and
  is a ... plea that the English universities abandon the compulsory
  study of Greek and Latin and make the study of nature an integral and
  predominant part of every man’s education.... The second essay is an
  outline of the advance in science made in the last quarter of a
  century, being the presidential address at the recent meeting of the
  British association for the advancement of science.... The closing
  essay is on the ‘Sleeping sickness’ which is now devastating tropical

  brought up by an austere grandmother who fought the child’s

  hero worship. Felicity comes under the spell of an old comedian, who
  discovers the spark of histrionism in her, but who discourages an
  ambitious aunt in starting the child upon the long road to stage fame.
  Nevertheless the start is made, and the reader is given an intimate
  view of hardships that pave the way to success, of heartaches and
  struggles that lie just back of the footlights. The great charm of the
  story lies in the unsullied freshness with which Felicity emerges from
  her developing process against odds to grace the high places in her
  profession.

  “The interest of these volumes as a whole, apart from the feeling, and

  the problem of philosophy is grasped, and the sustained effort that is
  made to escape from the Scylla of the static or ‘stagnant’ Absolute
  without falling into the Charybdis of subjectivism and pluralism. In
  their own peculiar way they contain much that is helpful towards the
  restatement of idealism which is the chief philosophical requirement
  of the present time. Why this irritating form? It is not only that the
  second volume is merely a somewhat less technical restatement of the
  first, but in the argument of each there is endless repetition. For
  whom, again, is the book written? The uninitiated will find far too
  little; the initiated would be satisfied with much less; the
  positivist who could understand it if he would is not likely to
  persevere long in the attempt. But all this might be passed over if

  Letters collected from Sir Thomas Lawrence’s voluminous correspondence
  which “correct and proper” epistles that they are and having little to
  do with his love affairs, tend to banish from the reader’s mind the
  story of the artist’s unhappy relations with Mrs. Siddons’ two

  The spirit of frenzied finance hovers over this tale in which figure a
  proud ex-governor of Virginia, who loses in a speculation game carried
  on with trust funds, a loyal daughter, and a hero who plays the stock
  market to retrieve the Virginian’s fortune. “It may be characterized
  as a nightmare of love and stock gambling, wherein the ‘System’ shakes
  its gory locks and brandishes a handful of bloodstained razors,
  stalking the while prodigious over the necks of its prostrate
  victims.” (N. Y. Times.) “What Mr. Lawson attempts to do is to show
  the degrading effect of speculation upon character.” (Nation.)

  “The reader has an uncomfortable impression of a stuffed dragon and a

  pieces of lurid description, and not a little moralizing.”

     − + =Lit. D.= 34: 509. Mr. 30, ’07. 210w.

  “The delineation of character requires more literary art than Mr.

  “The moral was Mr. Lawson’s first thought, perhaps, but the book shows

  A “life” made authoritative and significant through M. Rodin’s
  personal assistance. “From first-hand sources and with infinite pains,
  Mr. Lawton has compiled a connected account of Rodin’s career which is
  vastly more valuable as a document than as an interpretation.”
  (Putnam’s.) “Stress, strain, and struggle have been from first to last
  the dominant characteristics of the life of a man who stands almost
  alone amongst his contemporaries as a realistic exponent of plastic
  art, and who in spite of the great value of everything from his

  (Int. Studio.)

                  *       *       *       *       *

  “Viewed in the most favourable light it is a useful compilation and
  gathering together of scattered fragments of criticism and biography
  emanating from more competent pens. It has, consequently, some value
  as a work of reference, more especially to the student who is
  conversant with Mr. Lawton’s sources of information. A more favourable
  opinion of the author would have been created were these sources more
  clearly acknowledged. As criticism, his book cannot have, even for the

  left of himself in his own letters, diaries and journals.

                  *       *       *       *       *

  Originally published in 1867 this work has come to its third edition
  which includes additions and changes. “The futility of a fifteen
  centuries’ struggle against the nature of things appears throughout
  the narrative, and is emphasized by the scandalous conditions reported
  in Italy and in Latin America during the latter part of the nineteenth
  century. Throughout all these centuries the church has been more
  tolerant of concubinage than of marriage among her clergy.... The
  republication of this monumental work is timely for the new crisis
  which the apparent irreformability of the Vatican seems to be bringing
  on.”

                  *       *       *       *       *

  =v. 3.= The first two chapters of Mr. Lea’s third volume are upon
  “‘Torture’ and ‘The trial’ and complete his study of the practice of
  the Inquisition; five others, beginning with ‘The sentence’ and ending
  with ‘The auto de fé,’ cover what he has to tell us of its
  punishments; and the closing four, on ‘Jews,’ ‘Moriscos,’
  ‘Protestantism,’ and ‘Censorship,’ open that survey of its spheres of
  action which is to fill also most of his final volume.”—Am. Hist. R.

  =v. 4.= The author’s study of the Inquisition, brought to a close in
  this volume, results in the conclusion “that its work was almost
  wholly evil, and that, through reflex action, the persecutor suffered
  along with the persecuted.” The volume deals with curious phases of
  doctrine and superstition prevalent at that time, such as sorcery and
  the occult arts, witchcraft, Jansenism and the varied political and
  social conditions which fostered not only the Inquisition itself but
  the tendencies that it was intended to combat.

  The book aims “to give as simply as possible the subject matter of the
  Institutes of Gaius and Justinian.” This the author does “not by
  translating or commenting on the original texts, but by describing
  clearly and concisely the substance of the law revealed to us by those
  texts. The historical point of view is omitted, except so far as it is
  necessarily involved in recording the fact (e. g.) that the forms of
  execution under the Antonines were different from those employed under

  of the sections show considerable power of lucid exposition, notably
  that on servitudes, and again that on legacies and that on dos. There
  is a good summary of the slave’s position in the matter of contract.
  But it is a pity that an elementary work should contain so many
  mistakes, and it is not altogether desirable that a work, professedly
  of that particular character, should now and again, on no apparent

  Arsène Lupin is a gentleman burglar whose mind, cunning, gracious
  manners and clever histrionic powers are all employed in paving an
  artistic way for the trickery of his profession. Followed out into
  mid-ocean by a wireless message, his disguise wards off suspicion, and

  In Genoa, just before the plague descends upon her, is set this story
  of a group of artists, studying under the old Italian Maestro in his
  attic studio. A three stranded love motive tangles the plot into which
  is woven a double thread of mystery in the persons of a white swathed
  figure which haunts a young American art student and a demented
  painter who destroys her canvases as soon as she finishes them. All
  this throws a glamour over an otherwise modern romance in which a

  “Expressions of his own opinion on questions of law and conduct are
  rare and usually sound. There are few accessible authorities which
  have not been examined and digested. The absence of cross-references
  to earlier and later pages imposes much needless labor. Except in the
  ease of law reports and session laws, there are hardly any citations
  of the original authorities, not even of the pages of the convention
  reports, from which quotations are made. The book is indispensable to

  A two-volume photogravure edition of a work devoted to America’s
  island possessions. The first volume includes the Great Antilles,
  Porto Rico, Guam, and Hawaii, while the second is devoted entirely to
  the Philippines. The history, growth, political development,
  industries, and resources of the islands are treated with little
  attention to controversial questions. For which omission in the second

  of the former governor, William H. Taft.

  Over the story of John Smith the author has thrown the glamour of
  romance. He has written a historical novel in which all that is
  history and all that is novel is alike familiar to our ears. It is a

  Mr. London sets about the novel task of deducing from the dream
  glimpses of the present day sleeper, evidences of his evolution from

  Jean Fanshaw is right as a trivet, though wilful and a born fighter.
  Her ungovernable temper sends her to the reform school, she escapes,
  but is persuaded by a clean, strong young artist rusticating in

  forth with a clear record, and enters the maelstrom of shopgirl life
  in New York. Her fight against the temptation on every hand is finally
  rewarded when her artist hero of long ago finds her and makes her
  castles in Spain a reality.

  In the prologue of this drama the dramatist has imagined the players’
  quarter of a theatre of Herculaneum to be unearthed. An archaeologist
  present finds a papyrus scroll containing the players’ copy of “Sappho
  and Phaon.” The play presents Sappho created entirely from the bits of
  her verse that have been preserved. Among Sappho’s lovers are
  Pittacus, the Mitylene tyrant, and Alcaeus, while Sappho herself loves
  Phaon, a slave, who is bound to his slave mate Thalassa. Pittacus
  relinquishes his suit while Alcaeus persecutes Phaon. The tragedy
  grows out of these conditions, and into it are woven the traditional
  vengeance of the gods, with the modern note of symbolism and
  mysticism.

  rivalled in power and wealth the churchmen of Tours and the dukes of
  Brittany, Cambord with its master-builders’ massive art, Amboise, the
  rival of the capital in cradling the thought and action of fifteenth
  and sixteenth century monarchs, are described, with many another
  château, in the light of their monumental glory. The volume is

  A story for young people which turns back to France in the 16th

  An Indian prince educated at Eton and Oxford and a young Englishman
  continuing the work of opening the great road thru Chiltistan begun by
  his father, are the principal figures in this story which deals with
  the English rule over India.

                  *       *       *       *       *

  Mason’s hands becomes a veritable fragment of Doom.”

  Whatever of deep sentiment, of resolution and also of villainy there
  is in the tale is magnetically associated with the ice fields of the
  Alps above Chamonix. There is an unrelated company of people upon the
  stage of the little drama, chief among whom is a brave-hearted girl
  who took her lesson of life from the Alpine guides—“If you have
  knowledge that can save a life—well you have got to use it, that’s the
  law.” Tired of her mother’s vain life, she hunts up her father, whom
  she has never seen, and tries to operate the law she had learned by
  saving a soul from the net which her dissolute father had drawn about
  it. The tale is one of her failures and successes.

  Mr. Matthews believes that the church in its broad significance of
  institutional Christianity is facing a crisis, namely, the need that
  it define its attitude toward formative forces now at work. He looks
  to the church to correct these forces, to inspire them with its own
  ideals, to insure that the results shall bring about a better
  to-morrow. He discusses the church in its relation to scholarship, to
  the gospel of the risen Christ, to the gospel of brotherhood, to
  social discontent, to the social movement and to materialism.

  The scene of this story is laid in and about Leipzig. A young Afghan

  until the day of the execution of a girl who is the exact counterpart
  of the countess. By skilful manoeuvering he effects a substitution,
  having prepared the countess’ body by means of drugs so that the
  tissues would not pass into the death rigour for a prolonged time. He
  transfers the memory section of the brain from the dead countess to
  the girl whose life he has saved, restores her to health and to the

  “Starting with Rousseau’s view that Naples should be visited in summer
  and St. Petersburg in winter, Mrs. Meakin makes the Russian capital

  The volume deals with the broad general subject of western Canadian

  One of the runners is a large-souled, unselfish girl, the other a
  jealous, narrow-minded, self-constituted rival. Beulah Marcel’s art
  career from the lowly rounds of a cameo-cutter’s apprentice to the
  point of distinction as a sculptor is unselfishly subordinated to that
  of Enid Rahfield spares no effort, good or evil, to win much-coveted
  fame. The scene shifts from New York to Paris, and at every pause of
  the runners, the love interest creeps in, and with it,
  misunderstandings which are fully accounted for at the mention of
  “artistic temperament.”

  Senator Jules Méline, sometime minister of agriculture, President of
  the representative chamber of France, and Prime Minister, has here
  given minute and careful instruction on manufacturing and industrial
  questions in a most interesting manner. “The great object of the
  book,” says Justin McCarthy in his preface “is to convince the world

  in all or most countries, is now the nearest and the surest means for
  the mitigation or the removal of the troubles which have come on the
  working populations everywhere, and that the present is the

  Here the reader finds less of the art galleries, churches, and museums
  than of the “life of Paris, and above all, the joy of the life of
  Paris.... The streets and boulevards, the cafés and restaurants, the
  various forms of amusement, the poverty and the picturesqueness of the

  All about three brave hearted girls’ struggles for success on Grub

  “Not a treatise, but only a text-book, and only an elementary
  text-book. The authors nowhere pretend to thoroughness in treatment.
  They discuss only the principal types of ‘higher structures:’ the
  continuous girder, the drawbridge, the suspension bridge, and the

  The subtle satire upon our modern tendency to embrace newly coined
  religions which underlies this story will not mar the tale for mere
  lovers of romance but will make it for those who see the humor in
  today’s sects and religious colonies. One Herman Stein has invented a
  religion of “toil and triumph” and associates with him in the creation
  of a fitting setting for his community a young architect with a
  showman’s instinct. To this combined Mecca and Luna Park comes the one
  woman. The two men contend for her favor and the one by sacrificing
  all to save her gains her love.

  British state telegraphs: the purchase of the telegraphs, in 1870,
  from the companies that had established the industry of telegraphy;
  and the subsequent conduct of the business of telegraphy by the
  government. “Both parts contain a record of fact and experience of

  A sure cure for the runaway malady. The good work of parents in
  restraining dissatisfied boys is helpfully supplemented in Mrs.
  Miller’s story. Harry Barnes persuades a playmate to run away with
  him. Their experiences lead to a half starved condition in which their

  some one drops in and tells a runaway story which shatters some

  A little girl of thirty years ago is the heroine of Mrs. Miller’s

  “A possible objection to the proposed course lies in the introduction
  of the vernier and the micrometer calimeter. The use of these
  instruments seems contrary to the authors’ attempt to avoid the
  ‘creeping-over’ of the methods and the instruments of research and
  specialization from the university into the high school, where they
  have absolutely no place. The same objection might be urged against
  the use of per cent. errors and discussion of accuracy of
  measurements. The book is to be commended, not only for its
  improvements over older manuals, but also as part of a _completed_ and
  _tried_ course.” F. R. Watson.

  Alderson Cree is shot by an enemy and upon his death-bed exacts from

  define the peculiar sort of ecstacy wherein Correggio’s Corregiosity

  realized himself only a handful of the classical pictures, notably the
  Io, the Ganymede, and perhaps the Antiope. As the favored decorator of
  the provincial and by no means highly cultured court of Parma.

  An intimately analytical biography of Patrick Henry thruout which the
  white light is turned upon him. He lives again in the atmosphere of
  the revolution, becomes the center of situations and scenes which he
  dominated, is lawyer, orator, soldier, statesman and executive, and is

  A simple, straightforward, withal complete sketch of our president,
  showing the rounds by which he did ascend to the present heights from
  which he defends and promulgates America’s sturdiest democratic

  “Less a work for the beginner than for the student who has already
  acquired a certain familiarity with experimental chemistry. It is in

  The book is divided into sections, the first of which deals with

  A stirring drama which involves the throne of Austria is here enacted
  among the Virginia hills just outside of Washington. The love story of
  the truly American heroine who, in spite of herself, follows her heart
  against her reason, and of the hero, heir to much Austrian greatness,
  who does his country service and then renounces all for the democratic
  life of an American, in itself holds the reader enthralled. But there
  are added to it many other interesting characters and some scenes of
  war and strategy, which will endear the book to lovers of adventure.
  The plot is well devised, the romance pretty, the encounters of both
  sword and word are clever; in all the story is a worthy successor to

  A western girl as unconscious of her beauty as of her great wealth
  practices rigid economy during her four years at an Illinois college.
  The serenity of her wholly satisfactory life is interrupted by the
  co-executors of her estate, one a Chicago lawyer who wishes to marry

  properly trained by wealthy relatives. She accepts the latter
  proposition, becomes plastic to the touch of a skilled social artist,
  is led into an engagement with an English duke, breaks it and weds the
  man of her old college days who had devoted his life to becoming

  Written for the Longfellow centenary. The book “can be read through in
  less than two hours, and can be bought for less than a dollar; but
  neither of these facts should be of use in measuring the amount and
  duration of the impression it ought to make upon a receptive reader.
  The poems chosen number thirty, and include ‘A psalm of life,’ ‘The
  wreck of the Hesperus,’ ‘The bridge,’ ‘The cross of snow,’ and other
  favorites, concluding with ‘Morituri salutamus.’... Perhaps the most
  valuable point made by Mr. Norton is to be found in the paragraphs in
  which he shows how completely Longfellow was the product of a simple
  and refined New England, which had gently broken with the Puritan
  régime and was filled with an optimistic belief in the orderly
  evolution of men to individual and national felicity in a new and
  favored world. Purity, naturalness and kindness were the fundamental
  characteristics of Longfellow, and these were in the main, the
  fundamental characteristics of the people who first welcomed his
  self-revealing poems.” (Forum.)

  Poems in which “the feet of children are set dancing.” They deal with
  the Kingdom of dreams in which a journey is made to old Japan. Back of
  the fantasy are serious lessons and vivid pictures of Japan with
  kaleidoscopic glimpses of pirates, mandarins, bonzes, priests,
  jugglers, merchants, ghastroi, etc.

  “There is a proficiency in the workmanship that, coupled with Mr.

  “The prolific Mr. Oppenheim has again brought forth a mouse.”

  retired from the political arena, is dragged back to the scene of his
  former successes by the villain of the plot, there to suffer intrigues

  One finds In the malefactor of Mr. Oppenheim’s story a companion study
  to the hero of his “Prince of sinners.” Grown ascetic and bitter
  during a period of unjust imprisonment, Sir Wingrave Seaton, at the
  end of his confinement, slips into the world incognito for purposes of
  revenge. His nature is too generous to permit him to carry out his
  scheme of injury. Under the mask of indifference, even cruelty, he is
  a philanthropist. After numerous logical digressions the love interest
  shapes itself into a typical bachelor’s romance.

  The daring incidents which give life to this tale take the reader back
  to the days of the Pretender, Charles Edward Stuart. Beau Brocade, a
  cashiered army officer of high birth, is dropped from the army for
  justly chastising a superior officer. He becomes a chivalrous
  highwayman, robbing rich men and extortioners and dropping many of the
  guineas so secured into Wirkworth’s poor box. His heroism, his
  chivalry, all his qualities of knighthood are called into play in
  aiding one Lady Patience Gascoyne to free her brother from the charge
  of traitorship to the king. As a reward he is restored to the army and
  wins the hand of the heroine in spite of the machinations of a titled
  rival.

  The three parts to Professor Ormond’s book are, “(1) an analysis which
  sets forth the two methods by which man seeks to realize his world:
  the method of external observation ... and the method of inner
  reflection ... (2) a synthesis which, while it justifies the two
  methods revealed by the analysis, sets forth the necessity of a
  synthesis of them and an attempt to realize it; (3) a series of
  deductions, which might more properly be called corollaries, dealing
  with a number of themes of general philosophical interest.” (Nation.)

  The scenes of this series of novels are all laid in some city of the
  Old world vitally interesting from the standpoint of history. “Mr.
  Osborne has selected Perugia and the period of Vannucci Perugino as
  the place and time of his romance. The artist and his pupil,

  Somewhat similar to “The wrecker” written by the author and his
  step-father, Robert Louis Stevenson. Answering an advertisement for
  men willing to take risks for great gain, “the adventurer” enlists in
  a mysterious project of seeking treasures hidden beyond the South

  Schmidt is a stolid East-Side German shopkeeper. “The inner Schmidt
  was as much a butter-slicer and ham-shaver as the outer article. He
  was consistently Schmidt all the way through.” Yet when he loved Ella,
  his colorless life changed, he became a man of feeling, capable of joy

  The motor mad hero and heroine of this story meet unconventionally by
  the roadside when the heroine’s car breaks down opportunely and all
  goes well save for the sorry fact that her parents cannot bring
  themselves to approve of a young man who made his fortune thru the

  “The present volume by a Göttingen professor gives in a compact form
  to the general reader the main points in the great controversy that
  now seems to have been fought almost through.... He points out that it
  is not in the proper domain of science, but ‘in the teacup of logic
  and epistemology that the storm in regard to the theories of the

  naturalism, that there is no such thing as free creative mind, is

  A finely wrought tapestry reproducing the house builded upon a rock.
  David Claridge, a sturdy English Quaker carries the new civilization
  of the West to the Egyptian East. He becomes counsellor and confident
  of Prince Kaïd and fights his battles for him. The story is a
  reënactment of the terrors of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego in the
  fiery furnace, and of Daniel in the lions’ den; for David, invincible
  in the might of truth, is unharmed by the fire which is the consuming
  traditional and superstitional heathenism and the lions which are
  treacherous oriental trickery and love of revenge.

  An automobile story which does not content itself with the gentle
  excitements incident to motoring, but which involves a young
  Englishman, who undertakes to champion a mysterious lady who drives a
  blue car, in a series of strange complications which do not stop short
  of murder. The villain, also equipped with a car, is as diabolical as
  any of his class and the whole story moves at third speed along a
  highway bristling with dangers to a conventionally happy ending.

  John Glynn is an Englishman who has made a fortune in America on her
  rough frontier and goes back to London to do settlement work in that
  unlovely quarter known as The Nile. Here he works side by side with a
  young woman who is secretary of his district and this, of course,
  furnishes the romance of the book, but its vital interest lies in the
  life of the criminal quarter in which they labor and in the strong
  characters, both good and evil, which they encounter.

  “The more serious will welcome a book which contains more than a mere

  without its instructive side, and despite occasional tendencies to
  claptrap, and frequent exaggeration, has here and there touches of

  some of the problems which face the worker among the poor.”

  the origin of the race in question: an effort to trace its

  A book designed for collateral reading and class discussion which
  “interprets in a specially suggestive and stimulating way the meaning
  and significance of recent social changes with which the practical
  social worker is so actively engaged and to which he is so close in
  point of time and contact that he may well fail to secure for himself

  A study of a group of English writers including Keats, Shelley, Byron,

  with respect to intellectual content, to set forth their ideas upon
  religious and philosophic subjects, and to discuss their attitude

  These letters set forth the experiences of the colony of Northerners

  of 1862 when, after the capture of the forts at Hilton Head and Bay
  Point, South Carolina, the Sea Island region fell into the hands of

  “This little book sketches a philosophy of religion from the
  standpoint of theistic evolution. The questions discussed are such as
  ‘inevitably present themselves to anyone who seriously considers the
  problem of human existence.’ The postulates—or conclusions?—of the
  author’s theory are: ‘(1) The existence of a Deity; (2) the
  immortality of man; (3) a Divine scheme of evolution of which we form

  A Chicagoan tells how she takes a new lease of life during a spring

  A story of the cruel persecution of the days of the Salem witchcraft,
  with much stress placed upon the spell of hypnotism and imposture. It
  mainly concerns a very charming girl who comes under the witchcraft

  1806, with a crisp sketch of the armies, the leaders and the
  lieutenants on both sides, and gives a careful description of the
  topographical features of the difficult theatre of war—its marshes and
  forests, its mud and snow, its summer heat and winter tempests. Then
  follow the several operations, from that beginning in November and
  culminating in the battles of Pultusk and Golymin at Christmastide,
  1806, through the butchery of Eylau in February and its succeeding
  winter quarters, the siege of Danzig, and the ‘final triumph’ at
  Heilsburg and Friedland in June, 1807, followed by the treaty of

  of the men and married to one of them. This must be admitted to be a

  ‘facts’ as such. What he offers is a series of conclusions (based as
  they must be, on an intimate knowledge of facts) on the character and

  indiscriminate pursuit of the system there. He says “Trading with the
  public credit, whether state or municipal, must, of necessity, lead to
  stupendous financial liabilities, add to the burden of the rates,
  weaken municipal credit, bring about inequality of taxation, interfere
  with the natural laws of trade, check industrial and scientific
  progress, stop invention, discourage individual effort, destroy
  foreign trade, establish an army of officials, breed corruption,
  create an aristocracy of labor, demoralize the voter, and ultimately
  make socialistic communities of towns and cities.”

  A serious treatment in which “Mr. Post ... argues that without
  unifying love marriage is essentially no better than concubinage.
  Genuine marriage is not created by the formal ceremony that is
  requisite to declare it; it exists before such declaration; it dies,
  if the love that constitutes it dies; it is reasonable and also
  conducive to moral interests that there should be a conventional
  release from the remaining conventional bond.” (Outlook.) “The natural

  In the interests of psychology, to prove how great a part the
  conscience of a criminal plays in the detection of his crime, two
  friends devise a daring test. They substitute the body of a man who
  died at a hospital for Dr. Horace, who promptly disappears on a two
  weeks’ vacation. They arrange the body so that murder is evident, they
  furnish a motive and every clue points to Wallace, the other man in
  the plot, as the murderer. Then follows the work of the detectives on
  the trail of the murderer without a conscience. The story is
  interesting, and the end is clever, altho it evades the psychological
  point.

  Indians and their life, and not enough attention to conditions among

  To be complete in two volumes. The work is a study of the history of
  the prohibitory and expurgatory indexes, together with some
  consideration of the effects of Protestant censorship and of
  censorship by the state. It includes a list of the more important
  decrees, prohibitions, briefs, and edicts relating to the prohibition
  of specific books from the time of Gelasius I., 567 A. D., to the
  issue in 1900 of the latest of the church under Leo XIII.

  =v. 2.= “The theological controversies in France, Germany, England,
  and the Netherlands, from 1600 to 1750, are first discussed. These are
  followed by a study of the treatment of the Scriptures under
  censorship in these countries and Spain, and then the author considers
  the relations of the censorship to the various monastic
  orders—Jesuits, Dominicans, Casuits Seculars, and Regulars.” (N. Y.

  descriptions of examples of condemned literature, and discusses the
  subject of censorship.

  state of his vision,’ passing on to concentrate his attention first on
  Italy, then on Florence, and finally on Dante himself, tracing his
  literary antecedents, calling up one after another the possibilities

  Gascoigne square, Whitborough, is made the scene of a pretty love
  story in which two young girls from Australia come into the square as
  mistresses of a board school. Here they meet a number of interesting
  people, differing widely in character and social position, and here
  the mystery of their father, who had lived his young life in this very
  square, is unravelled, leaving them free to marry the two young men of
  wealth and family who have come to love them. It is not the mystery,
  however, which is uppermost for interest centers around the quaint
  characters and their old prejudices: the social climbers, dear old
  Miss Blackiston, wholehearted Ben Cox, Lord Streybridge, narrow-minded
  Mrs. Petch, spiteful Miss Marston, and all the others.

  “As the preface states, ‘this book is written from the standpoint of
  historic materialism.’ Its aim is to show how past forms of the family
  and of the state have been determined by economic conditions,
  especially by methods of production, and to demonstrate incidentally
  that Marxian socialism is the only means of social salvation and the
  natural goal of development. The author shows considerable
  acquaintance with the socialist school of social and economic writers,
  but beyond that his acquaintance with the scientific literature of the
  subjects upon which he writes is very limited.”—Am. J. Soc.

  “In the first instance it is intended for ‘undergraduate students in
  philosophy,’ and is not supposed to assume any previous acquaintance
  either with ethics or with general philosophy. In the second place, it
  aims at working out an ethical theory which shall be in some sense a
  higher synthesis of Green and Sidgwick, to whose memory the book is
  dedicated.” (Lond. Times.) “In the first volume, Mr. Rashdall deals
  with the fundamental conceptions of ethics.... In the second volume
  the author examines what he regards as the metaphysical implications
  of ethics, but he hardly proves the propriety of introducing such a
  discussion Into a treatise on moral philosophy.” (Nation.)

                  *       *       *       *       *

  “This treatise, though concerned with the investigation of profound
  questions, is singularly successful in its avoidance of all
  ponderosity and pedantry. Written in a pleasing style, it is readable
  throughout. The problems discussed are clearly presented, the line of
  argument is always developed with logical care and dialetical skill,
  the discussions of even the most abstract questions are uniformly

  The author begins his study of tracing the relations of Christianity
  to the social crisis as far back as the days of the greater Hebrew
  prophets. He finds reasons for the “halting and groping,” conscience
  of Christendom, “perplexed by contradicting voices” and finds reasons
  for “freeing an honest man’s heart” on the maxims of the past and the
  imperious call of the future.

  “Of less value is the later and constructive part of the work where an
  attempt is made to outline the immediate measures which should be
  taken to mitigate the evils of our time. Such questions cannot be
  successfully treated in the form of rhetorical appeals to somewhat
  vague and elementary feelings and without a mastery of technical
  economic reasoning which is not revealed in the work itself.” Charles

  Ackroyd, the young professor of much intellect and worse than no
  family, comes in contact with a wholly new social scheme of things
  thru his position on the faculty of a great university. The daughter
  of the head of his department stands for the world of culture he has

  “The book itself is short, embracing but three hundred and fifty pages
  of not very compact print. The main topics treated are the author’s
  early life in Texas, his part in Congress during three or four years
  prior to 1861, the organization of the Confederacy at Montgomery, the
  civil war, as viewed by an active and efficient cabinet officer in
  Richmond, and the problems of reconstruction. The most interesting

  In this poem-drama of American life a modern capitalist in blank

  The philosophy of success is the outgrowth of definite basic
  principles. Mr. Reich denounces the “fluke” idea of success and plants
  success on the principle of energetics. The hope of the author is to
  establish an ideal so universal that it may be used by anyone in any
  walk of life for the attaining of honest, successful results.

  “In spite of this ill-advised plan of constructing a mathematical
  framework on which to fashion a body of doctrine dealing with the most

  so ingenious, and so suggestive, that its weaknesses and imperfections

  “The book not only lacks evidences of seasoned thought, but of
  familiarity with the more recent literature bearing on the discussion

  “The unnamed author’s theme is the radical question of our time, ‘What
  is Christianity?’ and his text is Lessing’s remark, ‘The Christian
  religion has been tried for eighteen centuries; the religion of Christ
  remains to be tried.’ By the Christian religion is meant a body of
  religious doctrine supported by an ecclesiastical organization. The
  religion of Christ is the attitude of the spirit toward God and man
  that Jesus manifested as controlling his life.”—Outlook.

  “The story of three boys who go out from Cottage City in a small yacht
  and who are caught in a storm and run down by a larger vessel, a
  filibuster. They are rescued by Captain Dynamite, who carries them off
  to Cuba. There, having sent word home that they were safe, they take

  outside a book would be able to do. Harry Hamilton rescues Juanita, a
  young Cuban girl, who is in prison, and who escapes in his

  The author does not cover the broad field of general ornithology but
  narrows his scope to include only groups of birds of special interest
  to sportsmen. These he treats in a manner to be of interest also to
  the professional ornithologist and to the general reader. Fair
  sportsmanship is the keynote, discountenancing record-killing
  slaughter. Hunting yarns and bits of hunters’ wisdom gathered here and
  there over the gun-barrel mingle with the observations. Nearly ninety
  birds are described, located and illustrated in full-page half-tones.

  that of Virgil and Ovid. The book outlines the part that reading
  should play in the field of classical study, compares Latin and

  In this narrative told by means of various passages of scripture,
  special stress is laid upon the qualities of the man David, the
  frailties over which the might of character triumphed, the friendship

  A love story in which a Siamese cat and a pigeon-blood ruby figure
  largely. It “swings along at a high speed and there is plenty of
  Asiatic coast atmosphere, of the semi-tourist, semi-native sort. The
  local color, appears veracious with its mixture of bad smells and pink

  “Besides the biographical matter furnished by Signor Ventura, the

  which was given twenty-two years ago at the New York Academy of music
  in a memorable production of Shakespeare’s ‘Macbeth,’ Edwin Booth
  taking the title-role on that occasion. The second part of her Memoirs
  is devoted to an analysis of six of the principal parts in her

  Plot and action abound in this story of confused identity. In his
  college days, only four years past, the Reverend Harry Sanderson was
  known to his fellows as Satan Sanderson. There crosses his path one
  day an old associate, Hugh Stires, the degenerate son of St. James’
  richest parishioner, and so closely resembling Sanderson as to cause
  all the trouble that ensues. The ghosts of the past appear, but are
  downed by the invincible might of the young rector. The degenerate
  weds the woman Sanderson loves, proves unworthy of her, and throws
  himself upon Sanderson’s mercy, and the latter in attempting to save
  him meets with an accident that robs him of his memory. The climax and
  the fall grow out of the confusion of identity that follows, and a
  ne’er-do-well’s one impulse of manhood.

  “The history of each town is given, some anecdotes of some of its
  distinguished sons and their careers told, old houses are described,
  landmarks pointed out, and places of historical interest shown.
  Pictures, too, are given of houses, sites of buildings, etc., and
  there are portraits, views of the town, etc.”—N. Y. Times.

  “The towns are taken up one by one, in an order extending from the
  mouth of the river northward. There is, however, little other order;
  repetitions are frequent, and in the selection of information to be
  included or excluded no clear purpose appears beyond that of
  furnishing entertaining reading matter.”

  “St. Catherine, surnamed Benincasa, was born in the year 1348 when
  Siena lay in the grip of the black death, the daughter of a well-to-do
  citizen, a dyer by trade. She grew to be the peacemaker of Italy and
  the revered friend of popes and princes. The present narrative of her
  life, without being remarkable in any special way, gives a measurably
  adequate picture, as biographical pictures go, of this remarkable
  woman.”—N. Y. Times.

  Young Jack, the greenhorn, at the opening of this tale leaves his
  school and his angry uncle and embarks upon the Flying Cloud to seek
  his fortune in Australia. But neither school nor uncle could have
  given him the training he received from the brown men of the crew, the
  two brave mates, the old Malay bo’s’n, and the captain, the victim of
  opium. It is a thrilling tale, the story of how Jack learned the ways

=Roberts, Morley.= Painted Rock, tales and narratives of Painted Rock,
South Panhandle, Texas, told by Charlie Baker, late of that city and

  A collection of ten short stories dealing with the citizens of Painted
  Rock, their “histories and their affairs.” There is a good deal of
  bloodthirsty revenge portrayed, and life seems to be cheap. The
  realism and its primitive setting will no doubt prove fascinating to
  people who look for the kernel of humanity amongst the waste of
  savagery.

  The honesty of the work of Beechey is emphasized in this study. “The
  task of tracing out the identity of Beechey’s sitters, which included
  most of the celebrities of his time has been pursued by Mr. Roberts
  with most patient industry and he has unearthed a mass of information

  An octogenarian’s reminiscences of deathdealing adventures. In spite
  of the fact that his mother predicted early death unless he reformed,
  Colonel Robertson is hale and hearty at the age of eighty-four. “The
  volume is full of good stories, telling anecdotes, gallant exploits
  and hair-breadth adventures, related in a manner which at once
  fascinates and compels admiration for the old officer and his
  comrades. Like Sir Evelyn Wood, Sir John French, and Sir Henry
  Hildyard, Colonel Robertson was a middy before he took to soldiering,
  and a love for the sea and life afloat bore fruit in many stirring
  episodes in his subsequent career, while to the credit of the seaman’s
  instinct thus early imparted may be placed that readiness of resource
  so frequently exhibited during the vicissitudes of his military

  “The convert” is not merely a novel, it is a strong plea for woman’s
  suffrage. The work of the suffragettes of London with their open air
  meetings in squares and on wharfs crowded with rude and unsympathetic
  mobs is glaringly described until the heroine, if not the reader, is
  drawn over to them and their cause. The heroine, now a splendid woman
  moving in society’s inner circle, was, when a young girl, deceived by
  the man she loved and led to sacrifice the child which was to have
  been hers. Now, with this burning loss in her heart and the cause of
  down trodden woman strong in her soul, she meets the man once more
  and, closing the past forever, gives him to the girl he now loves but
  asks in return his help in the cause, that by helping other women he
  may expiate his guilt toward one.

  most recent results of Chaucerian research, which are at present
  widely scattered in learned periodicals. The scanty facts that have

  Shakespeare and Molière, Chaucer took his own wherever he found it—and
  the social conditions and surroundings amid which and for which the
  poet wrote are amply set forth.” (N. Y. Times.)

  “By ‘the human element’ is meant, in distinction from divine
  revelations, ‘things that can be proved by ordinary historical
  testimony’—including, as Dr. Salmon assumes, the miraculous element in
  the gospels. His work is essentially devoted to an investigation of
  the sources of the gospel story, conducted with a purposed
  independence of traditional opinions.... ‘Editorial blunders’ are
  found in Matthew, and Luke is found to have ‘taken liberties with the
  earlier tradition’ of the resurrection. The Greek text only of the
  gospels, substantially that of Wescott and Hort, is given in parallel
  columns, beginning with the entrance of Jesus on his public

  “Intelligent direction for systematic and discriminating study” is the
  aim of this book. It meets the needs of four classes of student: (1)
  the college student, (2) the graduate student in oriental history, (3)
  the student of theology, and (4) the general student of the Bible. The
  book covers both the Old and New Testaments, and is divided into four
  parts: (1) Hebrew literature and history, reaching from the beginning
  to the fall of Jerusalem (586 B. C.); (2) early Jewish history and
  literature (586–168 B. C.); (3) later Jewish history and literature
  (168 B. C.–135 A. D.); (4) early Christian history and literature.

                  *       *       *       *       *

  “If there is one point in which the work does not come up to the
  standard laid down by the authors, it is that of answering the
  requirements of the graduate student. Otherwise, by a wise use of the
  literature assigned and a classification of the material thus procured
  there is little doubt that the book will prove very useful and helpful
  in filling the blanks in many students minds which should be occupied
  by Biblical history.” Ira M. Brice and John M. P. Smith.

  Schiller does not shirk these questions.” (Ath.) His best constructive

  “The book ... is divided into two parts: first, The man; second, I....
  Goethe’s ‘I place my all on nothing,’ ... is Stirner’s keynote to his
  egoistic symphony. His ego and not the family is the unit of the
  social life.... The world belong to all, but all are I. I alone am
  individual proprietor.... He repudiates all laws. Repudiates
  competition.... Socialism is a new god, a new abstraction to tyrannize
  over the ego.... Stirner was a foe to general ideas. He was an
  implacable realist.”—N. Y. Times.

  to criticism. It is vermicular. His thought is never confused, but he

  Here Dr. Schuster has presented to English readers the entire private
  or civil law of the German empire. “The immediate and practical
  purpose of the book is to aid the English lawyer in dealing with
  conflicts of law; and for this reason the German rules of
  international private law are set forth and compared with the English
  in connection with the matters in which choice of law has most often
  to be made. The author’s chief purpose, however, is ... to aid in
  placing the study of the English law on a higher plane.” (Pol. Sci.
  Q.)

  A character study of three distinct types. A mother whose peace of
  mind was constantly assailed by a selfish husband exploiting all the
  proprieties of life decides to live apart from him. She goes abroad
  and makes a cozy drawingroom the center of a warmth which she radiates
  after the fashion of her own serenity, sincerity and dignity. The
  daughter, devoted to the father, furnishes the second type. At his
  death the mother returns to find her daughter an arrogant, selfish,
  heartless girl unable to detect values. The third type is honest Jack
  Pennington whose integrity but reveals more convincingly the girl’s
  shallowness and the mother’s patient unselfishness.

  The letters of Mademoiselle de Lespinasse not only form a human
  document that reveals a tortured existence but are a symbol of the
  revolution accomplished in contemporary thought during her period,
  viz., “the change of the age of reason into the age of passion and
  sentimental license.” The author had access to archives heretofore
  unattainable which cleared up facts regarding the early life of
  Mademoiselle Lespinasse, her education, relations with the Marquis de
  Mora, and the public and worldly side of her character. The sketch
  embodies its negative lesson chiefly in this intense woman’s blind
  adoration for Count de Guibert. Her suffering strikes the universal
  note, and she pays the full retributive price for her wrong-doing.

  Little details that eminate from the store of a traveler’s latent
  impressions, the sort that fill the chinks of the memory but that are
  seldom offered to the stay-at-home tourist. In his shrewdly observant
  fashion, entertainingly humorous, the author tells the reader things
  worth remembering, and things that can be remembered for their very
  epigrammatic clearness. For instance, he says, “Ice is regarded with
  superstitious reverence in Italy, France and England. Common waiters
  are not allowed to touch the precious product. Instead, the head
  waiter hands it out in infinitesimal fragments with a pair of
  sugar-tongs.” The marginal illustrations are suggestive of the book’s

  A dissertation upon Sienese art as exemplified in her architecture,
  sculpture and painting. “General Seymour does not write as a
  specialist. He eschews technical language, and contents himself with
  setting down in simple terms the impressions produced upon him by
  study of the works of Duccio di Buoninsegna, the Lorenzetti, Taddeo di
  Bartolo, and their disciples and successors. It is interesting to
  note, from the records of these impressions, how strong an appeal to
  the modern mind may be made by an art which has deliberately adhered

  Based upon a study of the Homeric poems, this book deals with the life
  and times as reflected in the poet’s language. Hence it is
  philological rather than archaeological. The importance of the
  undertaking to the modern reader lies in the fact that Homer’s picture
  of the life of his age is the earliest account extant of the culture
  from which our own is a true lineal descendant. The cosmography and
  geography of the country are studied, the family, education, dress,
  food, slavery, trade, sea life and ships, agriculture, animals,
  worship, arms and war.

  While the chapters of this book are the personal experiences of two

  interesting articles of colonial furniture and bric-a-brac, they
  afford generous information concerning colonial furniture of every

  Uniform with “Cambridge poets,” this volume shares with the others of
  the series the excellencies of book making. Professor Neilson’s
  “radical procedure in frankly adopting a modern punctuation will
  probably please readers, if they notice it, and raise questions among
  scholars. His rearrangement of the plays according to chronology
  within the three well-recognized divisions of comedies, histories, and
  tragedies, by which ‘Tempest’ appears as the seventeenth instead of
  the first play, is likely to give qualms to readers rather than to
  scholars. Both innovations seem to me to be worth trying, and it is
  needless to approve the small amount of textual apparatus in such an
  edition and the consequent saving of space for a good glossary.”

  George Kennett, a soldier in the Peninsular campaign, returns to
  Running Horse inn in a little town in the south of England upon the

  brings misery to his brother’s home. He pays the penalty for the guilt
  which he was morally responsible for, although he is innocent

  While Walter and Anne Majendie are upon their honeymoon rumors reach
  the wife of scandal attached to her husband’s name. Anne at once
  enters the cloister of her own spiritual high mindedness thereby
  securing for herself a “sort of spiritual divorce from him, while she
  martyrised her body which was wedded to him.” Miss Sinclair delineates
  intimately the cold virtue of the wife as by degrees it drives away
  the half boyish, genuinely honest and wholly devoted husband who seeks
  consolation in a little shop girl. Only after terrible suffering does
  Anne realize that Walter has kept all his marriage vows except one,
  and she had broken all of hers, except one. Her understanding comes as
  a surprise, and permits the curtain to be rung down upon a happier
  group than seems possible from the stand point of logic.

  A slight story of some hundred pages. “Its narrator is a scientist who
  went to the South seas in search of a lost brother and found him on a
  tropic island where he had been living entirely alone for twenty
  years. At first absorbed in the music he composed, his one earthly
  passion, the brother had gradually been led, in his utter solitude, by
  contemplation, feeling, and will, to heights of philosophy ever calmer
  and wider, until at last mind and will together had enabled him to
  break the bonds of flesh and to hold communion with the spiritual
  world.” (N. Y. Times.)

  “It has a certain haunting suggestiveness, and enough crudities to
  make it exasperating to the critical reader. Like most of Mr.
  Sinclair’s work, it is keyed too high emotionally to be quite natural.
  And, as usual, he is so concerned with the thing he wants to say that
  it never occurs to him even to try to make his characters lifelike and
  convincing.”

=Singleton, Esther.= Dutch and Flemish furniture. **$7.50. McClure.

  A companion to Mrs. Singleton’s “French and English furniture.” “It
  opens with the splendour of the Burgundian court, where art and luxury
  first burst the fetters of stern mediævalism and where peace and
  plenty reigned at a time when the lands around were in the grip of
  battle or of civil war. It next plunges into the dark history of the
  religious wars and the emergence of a burgher state of staid habit and
  prudent outlay, though fully esteeming the domicile and eager for its
  comfort and adornment. Between the scheme of life of Duke Philip the
  Good and his nobles and that of the seventeenth-century Dutchman a
  great gulf is fixed, and Mrs. Singleton in her detailed and exhaustive
  work gives us ample material to realize the difference.” (Acad.)

  has allowed himself to speak of scientific thinkers in all branches of

  exasperating to those who believe and insist that a democracy must be

  A discussion based upon two series of letters. “The letters from labor
  leaders, in answering the question put to them, ‘What do workingmen
  want?’ state the commoner demands of labor for shorter hours,
  increased wages, and improved conditions, and embrace such concrete
  suggestions as postal savings tanks, government ownership and control,
  state board of arbitration, restriction of immigration, the closed
  shop, and protection of women and children. Employers demand loyalty,
  freedom in management of affairs, the open shop, a ‘fair’ day’s work
  for ‘fair’ wages, and respect for law and contract agreements. The

  meritorious, in spite of undoubted faults of style, exposition, and

  A popular treatise on the relations of alcohol to living organisms,
  especially to man. The subject is discussed from the medical and also
  the physical standpoint. On the one hand the author concludes that
  “There is nothing in medical experience which speaks against the
  moderate use of good alcoholic drinks by the public, but much that
  speaks in favor of it,” on the other, that the bodily cells of man are
  not strangers to alcohol and to its elaboration, that it nourishes,
  exerts a specific action on the nervous system, acts no less as a
  nutrient and a specific than cereals and sugar, and that the
  disposition to drink excessively has its origin in the peculiarities
  and circumstances of the individual, and that alcohol does not of
  itself possess the property of inducing excessive use.

  “Two young men, a clerk from a Midland city and an uncomfortable

  philosophic grandfather in seclusion.... Both fall in love with her,
  and she falls in love with the millionaire, Lord Blackborough, but,

  humdrum liking. Lord Blackborough continues to make ducks and drakes
  of his fortune, while the other, Cruttenden, becomes the hard

  domesticity, but she is soon repelled by the heartlessness of
  prosperity, and begins to turn to her first love. She is killed
  accidentally in his company, and he, too, mad with grief, dies in the

  put the reader in tune with immaterial influences, or—a thing scarcely

  The queens are the much loved teachers in a girls’ boarding school and
  the company consists of a group of fun loving girls of boarding school

  it” and there is much wholesome human nature in the tale.


* =Sterns, Justin.= Song of the boy. 15c. Ariel press, Westwood, Mass.

  The first note struck in the poem is that of “vivid glorification of
  the joys of healthy youth—wrestling, skating, diving, rowing,
  climbing, running, jumping, the subtler joys of the senses, the
  pleasures of the fresh fancy and imagination, of young sympathy and
  friendship.... Then other voices are heard. Death, the World, the
  Flesh, the Devil, address themselves to the boy, suggesting the
  pleasantness of the Primrose path and the wisdom of plucking roses
  while one may. Finally Love speaks in the crucial strophe of the
  poem.” (Nation.)

                  *       *       *       *       *

  A strange confusion in the relationship of a beautiful girl, who
  disappears mysteriously on her wedding day, and the man whom she was
  to have married is made clear in the course of this story by the young
  lawyer, Lester, and Godfrey, the reporter. Both hero and heroine are
  mistaken as to their real parents so that when the puzzle is but half
  solved it leaves them brother and sister. This makes a doubly
  thrilling tale which holds the reader’s interest through murder and
  mystery to the last page.

  In the vernacular of the rover, Sam Daly recounts his “rolling-stone,
  happy-go-lucky” experiences mainly on “Mississippi river steamboats
  and the rafts and landings alongside from Cairo to New Orleans.” Sam’s
  partners are his dog Rags and Clancy, the expert “tosser” of hot
  rivets into a bridge-builder’s bucket. They run the round of chance,
  sometimes are masters of fate, often a prey to it, but are ever
  cheerful philosophers.

  material which reveals Empress Eugénie in relation to court life
  rather than in relation to “state policies.” “The reader has served up
  to him small, detached chunks of history, isolated incidents,
  descriptions of festivities, scenes at court, constant praise of
  Eugénie’s beauty and charm, all mingled together without any attempt
  to trace either a logical sequence of events, development of
  character, or growth of purpose.”—N. Y. Times.

  A story written for the purpose of revealing the horror of the rubber
  traffic on the Congo, to show what has been the effect of the white
  man’s rule. Young Jack Challoner in company with his uncle makes a
  nobler fight than ever mediaeval crusaders undertook. The uncle dies
  with this admonition “help the negroes of the Congo fight the corrupt
  government that enriches itself on their blood; go to the
  fountain-head and expose the hypocrisy of King Leopold.” Jack carries
  on his battle with Samba at his side, Samba, whose woeful plight had
  first brought home to his heart the terrible realities of the rubber
  slavery. The tale abounds in thrilling adventure, bloodshed and
  cruelty.

                  *       *       *       *       *

  “The special literature of the subject has been mastered, and
  indebtedness is acknowledged to Mr. and Mrs. Harris, the energetic
  missionaries, for assistance to which is doubtless owing the
  exceptional accuracy and minuteness of the descriptions of the Central
  African scenery and animals. The young readers for whom the volume is
  primarily intended are not likely to find fault with it on account of
  the triteness of its characterisation.”

  “Whether a book for young people should be built upon a grave
  political problem, the data for which are taken from one side only, is
  a matter for serious doubt. The story is full of pathos and is

  Many regard Herbert Strang as the one upon whom the mantle of Henty
  fell. This is “an absorbing story which takes the reader back to the
  capture of Gheria and the battle of Plassey, and, as a matter of
  course, chronicles the brave deeds of an English lad.” (Ath.)

  Mr. Strang returns to a period lying back of the present days of
  rubber slavery which latter were treated in his “Fighting on the
  Congo.” The present story deals with an earlier time and a different
  region of the Great forest. “It is a picture of the last years of the
  Arab domination, when the remnants of Tippu Tib’s hordes, in remote
  fastnesses, pursued their evil traffic in humanity. The two pictures
  are companions and contrasts; but they have this in common: they
  attempt to show the native races at their best, as they may be and are
  when oppression is replaced by sympathy.”

  The history of the civil war is supplemented in this volume by stories
  which, though cast in the form of fiction, present the atmosphere of
  the times and give a vivid picture of some of the thrilling episodes
  which actually took place. They include boyish tales of a midshipman,
  a blockade runner, an adventure with guerillas, a raw recruit, how
  Cushing destroyed the “Albemarle,” President Lincoln and the sleeping

  face the question of earning a livelihood. They hit upon the idea of a

  “The title poem of the volume, a brief Morality play, called ‘The fool
  of the world,’ employs a style which admirably suits the theme,
  infusing into the simple colloquy between Man and Death all the dread,
  the fear, the mystery of mortality as they pervade ‘Everyman’ and
  other of the old Morality plays. Following this ... Mr. Symons has a
  group of ‘Meditations,’ poised and passionless as a Buddhistic
  reverie, fatalistic, ‘sicklied o’er with the pale cast of thought.’...
  Contrary to the mood of his prose, the prevailing note of Mr. Symons’
  poetry is negative and over his pages futility, and ever futility, is
  written.”—N. Y. Times.

                  *       *       *       *       *

  “[‘The fool of the world’] shows, for all its slenderness, strong
  dramatic power. It asks a question; it leads you on, as you fancy,

  occasionally lost confidence in himself and followed the advice of
  every person of authority he chanced to encounter. When he confides in
  his own faculty of insight he is still an admirable interpreter of the
  eternal miracles of beauty: when he mistrusts his own powers he
  becomes merely a conscientious student of the opinions of other men.

  This monograph “contains a critical interpretation of Fichte’s
  teaching concerning the Ego, Being, and Existence. Incidentally Dr.
  Talbot sets forth ... the relation of Fichte to Kant, the nature of
  ‘intellectual perception’ in both the critical and the absolute
  philosophy, and adds an important appendix to show that Kant’s ‘I

  The Frithiof saga which narrates the stirring adventures of Frithiof,
  a hero of the Northland and viking of its seas, is “noble, heroic, and
  free from exaggerated description or overwrought sentiment.... The
  central motives of the saga are his love for King Bele’s daughter,
  Ingeborg; the refusal of her brothers to sanction their marriage
  because the hero is not of royal birth; her unwilling marriage to the
  old King Ring; Frithiof’s exile and final union with Ingeborg.”

  A novel built up along the lines of socialism, with its setting in the
  lumber-yard districts of Chicago. A preacher of the gospel whose point
  of view is “We must teach these working people to respect the laws of
  the land,” a young Austrian socialist whose opinion is, “We must
  change the laws so that they can be respected,” an “egotistical
  philanthropic employer” and a group of women, subordinating their
  ideas to the men whose opinions they respect, occupy the stage of the

  The method used in this comparative study of religion “consists,
  briefly, in applying the principles of natural selection and the
  survival of the fittest to the great religions of the world, with a
  view to ascertaining which may justifiably claim pre-eminence on a
  basis of concrete services rendered to mankind.” (Outlook.) Social
  betterment is used as the basis for the test of conditions which
  appear in countries under the sway of Brahmanism, Buddhism,
  Confucianism, Mohammedanism and Christianity. “In each case his
  examination comprises distinct sociological departments—as, the
  condition of women and children, the individual situation,

  The ingredients out of which Miss French compounds her “Lion’s
  share” are many and varied: high finance with accompanying
  intrigue, kidnapping and consequent detective work, and love and
  adventure to suit the most satiated appetite. The hero is a United
  States army officer who occupies the centre of the stage and is
  champion-in-general. “When the time comes for him either to uphold
  the laws and constitution of his country as he has sworn to do, or
  protect and aid his relatives in a criminal proceeding, he decides
  on the latter course, easing his conscience by resigning his

  In this story which begins at West Point and later depicts army scenes
  during the civil war, the characters of two men are brought into sharp

  development of the character of Jenifer, a poor country lad, who
  discovers kaolin upon some land which he promptly buys from the needy
  owner, who does not suspect its value. This makes him rich and he goes

  “Two centuries after St. Francis of Assisi, his followers labored for
  a revival of religion contemporaneously with the revival of learning
  known as the Renaissance. A leading promoter of it was the saintly
  preacher of whom this volume is a memorial. An account of the moral
  and civic anarchy of the time forms the historical setting of the
  story of the revivalist’s missionary life, the popular enthusiasm he
  kindled, his trials with ecclesiastical opponents, his sermons, and,
  finally, of the two orders of the Franciscan brotherhood, from the
  less to the more rigorous of which he went over.”—Outlook.

  Katherine Crichton marries a big-hearted, broad-minded man whose work
  principles she does not understand, and therefore nurses unhappiness
  as a result of fancied neglect. An accident results in a physical
  state that promises her only two years of life, and she determines to
  give herself up to happiness and the romance which had been denied
  her. How her husband spares her the ignominy of dishonor and restores
  her to her home is handled with keen perception and an understanding
  of genuine nobility of heart.

  A strong young man loving life and freedom serves an ascetic uncle for
  seven years. The uncle dies bequeathing his vast wealth to a sect
  known as the Mystics. A sense of deep wrong leads the nephew to
  violate the uncle’s dying request to guard the sacred book of the sect
  until it could be turned over to one of the leaders. He copies it word
  for word, finds that the Mystics look forward to the appearing of a
  prophet, decides to play the rôle himself and to appear at the proper
  moment, his one aim being to secure the money out of which these
  people had defrauded him. His course leads to a dramatic though
  logical dénouement.

  A biographical and critical study of Rabelais written for the “French

  succeeded in making the primary colours once more effective. Even in
  Chile the black angel whose disciple puts sticks of dynamite among the

  “This volume has to do with Mazzini’s short-lived Roman republic in
  1849.... The volume is divided into three parts, the first ... tells
  the story of Garibaldi’s childhood at Nice, of his adventurous life in
  South America, and his romantic marriage ... of the condition of the
  Roman states from 1815 to 1846, and of the reform movements and
  democratic protests. This prepares the way for part second, which
  describes the defense of Rome, and part third, which treats of
  Garibaldi’s retreat and escape.”—N. Y. Times.

  Athens during the hey-day of its classical period is portrayed, the
  time when Athenian life stood for vigorous vitality and unblemished
  character. It is mainly of the things that have been too well
  preserved in antiquities for time to efface that Mr. Tucker writes;
  actual events, actual buildings; knowledge of manners, customs,
  ideals; of Attic virtues, vices, weaknesses, humors, drolleries; and
  knowledge of what law and society allowed.

  “If we must criticise, we would cast a doubt upon the statement that
  the Athenians were a mixed race. We can find no evidence of an Achaean
  strain in their ancestry. Nor do we hold that the Greek tongue was a
  Homeric importation. And to speak of the Propylæa as a ‘triumphal
  arch’ is surely misleading to the novice in these matters. Apart from
  these points, our only quarrel with Professor Tucker is the complete

  The service which Mr. Van Dyke renders is that of aiding the student

  forgeries; Themes of the masters; Workmanship of the old masters;
  Figure painting; Portrait painting; Genre painting; The animal in art;

  composition of masses, he perforce refers his reader to the picture
  itself.”

  Four groups of advisory letters written to four American women
  “occupying quite different places in the historical development of
  love.” Mrs. Van Vorst “thinks that the thing which counts about a
  woman more than anything else, from beginning to end, is her age.” She
  spends half her life “not being old enough and the rest in being too
  old.” And she tempers her advice accordingly. For example, “if a woman
  is over thirty-eight she must have patience in dealing with the man
  she loves; if she is less than twenty-five she may risk defiance in
  order to bring him to terms.” (Ind.)

  “Mr. Vaughan gives a generous interpretation to the Naples Riviera,
  including the Islands of the Blessed that float in a pellucid
  atmosphere in the enchanting bay. Everywhere he is resuscitating a
  dead past, from Herculaneum submerged in volcanic mud, and Pompeii
  long buried in a shroud of ashes, to Salerno of the once famous
  medical schools, to Pæstum with the temples that were dilapidated when
  S. Paul landed at Puteoli, and to Amalfi which was for a time supreme
  at sea till the now moribund Pisa contested the supremacy.” (Sat. R.)
  “The reader of these pages, therefore, will collect, with a minimum of
  effort, a little history, a little folk-lore, a little biography, a
  little literary reminiscence, and a little appreciation of the places

  While there is to be found political history in plenty in these
  letters, they constitute, in the main, a document “whose chief
  importance consists in revelation of character.... Even in her
  prejudices the queen commands admiration, while proof appears on every
  page of her innate rectitude; the masculine discernment which kept her
  feminine susceptibilities under control, her knowledge of business,
  which neither excused slackness nor pardoned obscurity, and her grasp
  of detail are all emphasized.” (Ath.)

  “His vampire is a personage of immense literary distinction, who moves
  among his contemporaries like a god, yet all of whose works are
  actually the product of others whose minds he enters, whose mental
  creations he steals, and whose vigor he saps.” (N. Y. Times.) Every
  note of originality which he discovers in any one he appropriates,

  “In this volume of verse the author’s theme is, for the most part, the
  anguish and the joy of adolescence. Some of the best poems are
  glorious riots of purely sensuous passion; others are despairing cries
  to some solidity of stay amid the turbulence of sense. The poet and

  “After recounting with brevity the influences of heredity and
  environment which acted upon Huxley’s early years, the author sets
  forth and discusses his teachings in biology, theology, education,
  morals, and psychology, and concerning individual rights and the
  gospel of work. He believes that two main forces were at work
  throughout Huxley’s life—‘the one that of the scientific investigator,
  full of enthusiasm, dominant, persevering, toiling arduously day by
  day.... The other that of the polemical philosopher, fond of
  arguments, combative ... fighting ... partly for victory, partly for
  the upholding of what he deemed a principle of ideal.’”—N. Y. Times.

  “After a general survey of the historical material, Professor De Vries

  professor who, unconsciously to himself, becomes the instrument of her
  reformation, can scarcely be taken seriously, and it seems to us that
  the author did not at first intend him for the monstrosity into which

  the past two hundred years or so helped in building up the modern
  science of healing, written with no other view than the setting forth
  of their discoveries and their title of fame. It has an ulterior

  Monologues which reveal the secrets of the inner sanctuary of the true
  home. The revelator is a woman who when reverses come goes with her
  husband to a little farm on the edge of a manufacturing town. She

  and believes that when women discover their social unequals, and
  cherish them till they grow into social equals, then we shall begin to
  get at the real secrets of that family which is the human race. She
  says: “We must recognize that the brotherhood of man presupposes not
  only the Fatherhood of God. but also the Motherhood of essential

  “Delia is the maid-of-all-work for a ‘family of six,’ and so well is
  she rendered that one gets an unaccustomed serious glimpse at many
  things perhaps before unseen, through reading her diary, the humor of
  which also exists independently of its simplified spelling à la

  pleasure her ultimate possession of a sweetheart of her own.”—Outlook.

  Mr. Watson “aims to predict the trend of Japan’s development, but he
  does so by analyzing and reasoning about the Japan of to-day, its

  perspectives as one which takes up basic aspects of character and
  derives by philosophical induction a knowledge of what is to be
  expected.” (Outlook.) Mr. Watson’s conclusion is “that Japanese
  development will not materially influence the civilization of the
  west; that as a universal fact Japan is almost negligible; that she
  will try to carry out her destiny without the aid of religion, yet

  The unique situations growing out of a wealthy young widow’s purchase
  of a husband constitute the fabric of this tale. Mrs. Merlin seeks out
  a good looking, broad-shouldered young Englishman, offers him the sum
  of twenty thousand pounds to marry her and protect her during a year
  of travel; at the end of which time either may end the contract.
  Shadows out of the past flit across the path of each which are

  to them an earldom and proves that their trial marriage has been

  A frank analysis and discussion of the factors that go to make what is
  known as the “Far Eastern problem.” The study resolves itself into
  three parts: Japan and the new position. China and the Chinese, and
  The powers and their influence. The author warns his reader against
  over confidence in the ten years’ truce now in operation, yet he does
  believe that it will be one of the greatest constructive victories of
  diplomacy, if, during nine years of the Anglo-Japanese alliance, a
  permanent Far Eastern peace is evolved. There are nearly two hundred
  pages of appendices including documents peculiarly pertinent to the
  subject-matter of the political chapters.

* =Weir, Archibald.= Introduction to the history of modern Europe. $2.
Houghton.

  The author reviews in their logical connection the chief groups of
  events which formed the groundwork of European history in the
  nineteenth century. The period covered is approximately that between
  1720 and 1820. “It treats of the political and social reforms
  introduced in the several monarchies, beginning with the opening of
  the eighteenth century; the changes brought about by the French
  revolution and by the Napoleonic despotism; the growth of personal
  liberty and political solidarity in the various countries of
  continental Europe after the downfall of Napoleon; the industrial
  revolution in England; the development of machinery and its influence
  on economics; and the advance in science; philosophy, and literature.”

  to the New Testament writings is lacking, and one who studies these

  The interest of the first part of this story centers in the efforts of
  young John Amherst, who occupies a subordinate position in the
  management of the Westmore mills, to solve some of the industrial
  problems there presented, particularly in providing for the health and
  safety of the employes. His opportunity to carry out his cherished
  plans seems to be at hand when he gains the sympathy and interest and
  finally the love of the beautiful young widow who owns the mills. The
  marriage follows, and a little later there befalls a terrible accident
  in which the wife is hopelessly injured and to put her out of her
  pain, Justine, friend and nurse, administers an overdose of morphine.
  Justine marries Amherst who thru the blackmailing scheme of a young
  physician learns of Justine’s act and for a time is overwhelmed with
  her technical responsibility of Bessie’s death while his reason tells
  him that she is innocent.

  Mrs. Wharton’s stage is occupied by two women—one French by birth, the
  other by marriage—and an American who at forty is dabbling in the
  rather unsafe business of aiding one of them in divorce proceedings in
  order to attain his belated happiness. In transferring her point of
  observation from a New York to a Paris drawing room, Mrs. Wharton has
  made the enamel of convention only a little more brilliant, and in
  suffering it to crack to reveal a shrivelled up heart, only shows that
  underneath such gloss, life has ceased to ring true to any standards
  of spontaneity. Family, society, and the church are inexorable Molochs
  to whom must be sacrificed infant joy, freedom, hope and even courage.

  Manitoba in its primeval loneliness is the scene of his story. A
  gently reared girl enters the wilderness to care for her brother in
  his last illness. After his death she marries a rough, crude,
  strong-hearted settler, then permits her regret for the step to drive
  the pride-hurt man from her. The situations which grow out of the
  separation and final reunion are all intensified by the savagery of
  the wild surroundings.

  A fine old English estate is the scene of most that happens in this
  tale. Ralph Darnley, the lost heir, returns to find Sir George
  Dashwood the next of kin in possession, but with only his grandmother
  and an old butler in his confidence Darnley plans to conceal his
  identity until he teaches the girl he loves, the daughter of Sir
  George, the futility of her Dashwood pride which stands in the way of
  accepting his suit. He aids a false claimant to a nominal control of
  the property, which renders Sir George and his daughter penniless. The
  daughter is thrown upon the world and when she has learned its lessons
  and discovered what true worthiness is Darnley reveals his identity
  and carries her back to Dashwood hall.

  =v. 1. The old world.= Beginning with the Asiatic period in the race

  A Christmas story of a “certain handful of dear New England women of
  names unknown, dwelling in a certain quiet village, alike unknown.” A
  new carpet, pews washed in lieu of paint, and cushions mended with
  care told on Christmas eve the story of days of hard work by the

  and apart from the rest, had lavished her strength on the Peabody pew,
  sacred to her early romance, where Christmas eve finds her alone
  taking the last stitch in the worn-out cushion. To this spot comes
  Justin Peabody the wanderer lover who, weary as the prodigal son,
  seeks the comfort and love of Nancy.

  The story of a young Westerner with genius for painting who is both
  the protégé of a young New York widow and the object of diabolical
  revenge on the part of the man whom his mother ran away from to marry
  his father. Apart from the melodramatic fury of the story a group of
  minor characters is drawn including “the cowboy in the clear, heady
  Colorado air, the genial freemasonry of the studio, Clarence, the
  lovable convert from civilization, dyspepsia and predigested food, and

  government of the majority of the people becomes an established fact
  in vindication of the principle that men are equal; while the
  industrial and social side of life is still left to be controlled by
  methods that have for their foundation the fact that men are unequal
  and that their rewards in life are to be unequal also.” His book
  answers the question raised in this statement.

  scale-like sequins and triply armed with brazen conceit, lewdness and
  loudness. In contrast, she draws a flattering portrait of the ‘Great

=Yardley, Maud H.= Sinless. *$1. Fenno.

  An emotional story growing out of the almost inconceivable situation
  of an unconscious exchange of wives. Two men return to England and
  their wives after ten years residence in India. That the wife of one
  should greet the husband of the other, be accepted in turn as his wife
  and neither find out the mistake for sometime seems a little short of
  impossible. The confusion is aided by the fact that both women
  responded to “Nell,” and both men were named “Kenyon.”

  “The central object of Mr. Young’s work is to reveal to the reader
  what he conceives to be the personality of Columbus. He has tried to
  discover, from a reverent examination of monographs, histories,

  “The book fills a gap in the popular historical library, and is
  excellently written. It should be widely read.”

  “On the whole this is an admirable historical study.”

       + =Ind.= 62: 912. Ap. 18, ’07. 580w.

  “The real value of this excellent book, illustrated and indexed as it
  is, consists in its descriptions, rich in coloring, of the social life
  of the period, the Dutch golden era.”

  “Though the Baroness van Nyevelt writes in strained and dignified
  style, the picturesqueness of her subject matter gives vividness to
  every page of her interesting narrative.”

  “The baroness’ book is a painstaking and readable contribution to the
  understanding of the great age of the Dutch republic. If we compare
  Mr. Barker and the Baroness van Zuylen van Nyevelt when they cover the
  same ground, it seems fairly clear not merely that the baroness is
  better acquainted with the best literature of the subject, but is more
  accurate, more fair and more critical in the proper sense of that
  term.”

=Zwemer, Samuel Marinus, Wherry, Elwood Morris, and Barton, James Levi=,
eds. Mohammedan world of to-day: being papers read at the first
missionary conference on behalf of the Mohammedan world held at Cairo,
April 4th–9th, 1906. **$1.50. Revell.

                                                                6–41773.

  “These papers exhibit the actual state of things both for better and
  for worse, as seen by eye-witnesses long conversant with the facts.
  They report both the difficulties in the way of betterment and the
  encouraging successes here and there achieved. For an understanding
  merely of the problems in world-politics which grow out of
  Mohammedanism these papers are valuable, much more for those which
  appeal to humanitarian and Christian sympathy. They effectually
  dissipate the allusion that Mohammedanism is on the whole, a
  beneficent religion, suited to the character of its adherents.
  Statistics, maps, and illustrations enrich the volume.”—Outlook.

  “As in all books of this character the essays vary greatly in merit.
  Especial mention should be made of those treating Arabia and India,
  which are excellent.”

  “The book has many serious blemishes: it omits North Africa from the
  field of view; its index is of little use; and its illustrations, good
  enough in their way, are hastily collected from the stock in general
  circulation. But its defects do not destroy its interest nor its
  profound importance as a careful exhibit of the practical results of
  Islam upon the races that have committed themselves to its guidance.”
